Doctors are needed only for handling the 5 per cent complicated cases. Similarly, most of the work at PHCs can be done by nurses as they are also empowered to prescribe certain medicines. The doctors can be contacted only for critical cases. This is cost-effective.”", "Just creating the new seats, however, will not help in retaining the nurses in India without good pay, said Dr P K Bharadwaj, secretary of the Delhi Voluntary Health Forum and advisor to the Association of Healthcare Providers of India. He is also the administrator at Saroj hospital in Delhi. Dr Raman agreed that the migration of Indian nurses to other countries has increased because of better pay, resulting in a shortage in the country.", "Dr Bharadwaj explained, “We used to see nursing professionals from South Indian states who would migrate to cities like Delhi for better pay. After training at smaller clinics, then at small nursing homes and then at bigger hospitals for five to six years, they migrated to other countries. Although, the pay in the government hospitals is better – about Rs 70,000 plus accommodation – no private hospital can pay that much.”", "He added, “This is because private hospitals other than the large corporate chains are mainly dependent on patients coming in through government schemes like Central Government Health Scheme, Ayushman Bharat and Delhi Arogya Kosh that pay very little. And, when it comes to insurance, the Third Party Administrators pay less to smaller hospitals further compounding the problem.”"]},

Potato farmers usually sell 15-20% of their crop immediately after harvesting from mid-February to mid-March. The remaining produce they keep in cold stores, which prevent sprouting and enable staggered sales till November-end.", "This time, the cold stores were carrying stocks even up to January-end.

But it also catalysed a new wave of health innovation, especially in the field of diagnostics in India and around the world, helping to increase testing capacity. And it has advanced self-testing and rapid disease detection, which has been game-changing.", "When there are big outbreaks, one of the most important things public health officials need to do is get a sense of where the disease is — and where it’s spreading. They need that information in real-time. Right now, PCR tests are the gold standard for diagnostics in terms of accuracy, but they’re slow and expensive. At the height of the pandemic, Indian lab workers were working around the clock and putting themselves at risk of infection. That was so the whole country could process about two million PCR tests a day — which cost about $5 each.", "I am even more excited about the next generation of PCR testing. Just one of these new machines can process 150,000 tests per day. And you can even use one sample to test for different diseases at the same time. Imagine using one nasal swab to test a child for COVID, flu, and RSV, all for a fraction of the cost of current tests. More testing equals more diagnosing, which means more lives saved. New PCR tests aren’t the only new diagnostic technology.", "An alternative to PCR tests are lateral-flow immunoassays — or Rapid Diagnostics Tests. If you’ve taken an at-home COVID-test lately, you’ve used one of these. The challenge here is that the world hasn’t updated how it manufactures these tests in decades. Pre-pandemic, the entire planet manufactured 3.5 billion tests a year. That’s for all diseases.", "A new diagnostic technique which is under development, called reel-to-reel lamination, could manufacture 16 million test strips per day — or 5 billion per year. In the future, I’m hoping that this extreme volume of manufacturing will revolutionise medical care everywhere, including here in India.", "That’s because it would allow medical providers anywhere — from doctor’s offices in big cities to clinics in remote areas, to travelling health workers — to offer point-of-care diagnostics.", "When backed by a scalable digital health platform, of the kind India is now building, we’re talking about being able to test for multiple diseases like TB, HIV or HPV anywhere, with basic swabs and no need for a specialised instrument.", "Another thing is that we’ll look at sewage, which is called environment sampling, and we will see outbreaks far more rapidly than ever before.", "Philanthropy makes up only two per cent of the spending in the US. Philanthropy is a solution to problems that government and private sector spending cannot go after. For example, in a disease like malaria, where the people affected don’t have the economic power and it’s not that attractive to make a vaccine or a new generation of drugs. There, philanthropy is very important. But when it comes to climate change, there isn’t nearly enough philanthropic funding — the two per cent is not enough to reinvent the industrial economy. We need to have price incentives and new innovative companies.", "That requires government investments and market-based solutions. Lowering greenhouse gas emissions will require building new products, new companies, and even new industries. It requires innovation on a massive scale to create the technologies to eliminate the “green premium.” That means making things as cheap to produce without carbon… as it is to produce things with carbon.", "That’s the only way the world will get to net-zero emissions — if people and companies can transition without the penalty of higher prices for going green.", "In 2015, when the Paris climate event was coming together, I was worried that the only topic of discussion was short-term metrics. It is good to have metrics. But this idea of getting innovation charged up was not on the agenda. I was able to have discussions with PM Modi and President Obama and other leaders and we put together five conferences called Mission Innovation in 2015. Eight years ago, I founded an organisation called Breakthrough Energy, specifically to raise private capital to take those ideas, fund start-ups and take those ideas into the market. Bringing in risk capital, IQ and acceleration of innovation. Usually, when we innovate, we don’t have a deadline. But in this case, we have a deadline to not only work on those ideas but deploy them in the markets. There a 100 companies that have been funded just because they have technologies that can help with the climate. Not all succeed. But it is really starting to happen.", "For example, some of our partners are developing new ways to manufacture carbon-intensive products such as steel and cement. Others are developing approaches to long-duration energy storage. They’re finding ways to store renewable sources of energy that are intermittent, like wind and solar. This way, they can generate power on demand — not just when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.", "Some of these clean-energy breakthroughs are happening right here in India. About 90 minutes away from here, in Rohtak, there is an entrepreneur named Vidyut Mohan, who is one of the fellows at Breakthrough Energy. His team is in the early stages of building a company named Takachar, which is developing the first portable biochar device for converting post-harvest crop and forest waste into valuable bioproducts. These include sustainable biofuels, fertilisers, and other chemicals.", "This is a transformative device — it is an affordable solution that will allow even the most remote agricultural communities to transform waste and avoid burning their own debris, which causes billions of dollars in economic loss, significant air pollution, and increased wildfire risk. Additionally, these bioproducts create another economic stream for agricultural communities from what was once just harmful waste.", "People are suffering from the effects of climate change right now. Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for only about four per cent of the world’s carbon emissions, but the region is bearing the brunt of climate change.", "Climate-related losses on many African farms are more than double those seen globally. As a result, the continent will have 32 million more hungry people by the end of this decade. But that projection does not have to come true. And the reason is that there are new tools helping farmers adapt to climate change.", "Some of the best innovation in crop research for climate adaptation is happening here in India. Just this morning, I visited the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (ICAR) in Pusa, a few kilometres away from here, where they are testing new crops, including chickpeas. Chickpeas are threatened by climate change. Higher temperatures could reduce yields by as much as 70 per cent. To prevent this from happening, the institute has been working with our foundation and other groups to produce new varieties. The results are still early. But in some cases, these plants are producing 10 per cent more chickpeas, plus are more drought resistant.", "India’s role in this big, global innovation boom. India has 700 million young people and educational institutions that are getting stronger. We need innovation from the world but specifically, from India.", "When I was at Microsoft, we chose to put a development centre here in 1998. And we did that because we knew India was going to play a major role in the global innovation ecosystem — not just as a beneficiary of new breakthroughs, but as an innovator of them. In addition as a scaler of breakthroughs.", "India can develop high-quality yet cost-effective innovations and drive their rapid adoption. Vaccines are a prime example. I spoke about India’s rotavirus vaccines. Well, they aren’t just in India. Through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, they’re now being exported, saving hundreds of thousands of kids’ lives around the world. India’s role in earlier vaccine development made it very well-placed for producing the COVID vaccine as well — it was a global leader in manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines distributed all over the world. And there’s a well-known example, which is being highlighted during the present G20, of India’s digital public infrastructure. Aadhaar and financial empowerment have provided hundreds of millions of people with bank accounts, digital identities and payment services. We use it to pay health workers efficiently and it is used by farmers for loans to get the right fertiliser. The innovation on top of that digital platform is really just beginning. The Bank for International Settlements estimated that India’s digital financial infrastructure enabled 80 per cent of Indians to be covered by bank accounts in less than a decade, a feat that may have taken 47 years by traditional methods. Many elements of this digital infrastructure are now being exported to other countries too. This year, India is presiding over the G20. It convenes world leaders at a moment of great progress for India and great promise for the world. We are all looking to India — a place of innovation, ingenuity, and brilliant minds — to herald a new era of global partnership which can overcome the world’s greatest challenges."]},

Once such information is sought, not furnishing the information…would be dereliction of constitutional duty imposed on the Chief Minister in terms of Article 167 (B).

However, the Governor referred to the tweet of the Chief Minister and to the letter dated February 14, and proceeded to state that since both the tweet and the letter were ‘petty unconstitutional but extremely derogatory’, he was compelled to take legal advice ‘on this issue’ and that he would decide on the request thereafter.”", "The court said that there was “no occasion to seek legal advice on whether or not the budget session should be convened. The Governor is clearly bound by the advice tendered to him by the Council of Ministers.”", "The Bench stressed that the “failure of one constitutional authority to fulfil its obligations under a distinct provision of the Constitution do not furnish a justification to another to decline to fulfil its own constitutional obligation”.", "The court also counseled the two sides for the need to maintain decorum in public discourse among constitutional functionaries.", "The Bench said that “while” it is “cognisant of the importance of free speech and expression and the fundamental value embodied in Article 19(1)(a), it becomes necessary to emphasise that constitutional discourse has to be conducted with a sense of decorum and mature statesmanship, particularly in the context of the constitutional dialogue which is conducted between functionaries”.", "The SC said that “political differences in a democratic polity are acceptable and have to be worked out with a sense of sobriety and maturity without allowing the discourse to degenerate into a race to the bottom”.", "It said that “unless these principles were to be borne in mind, the effective implementation of constitutional values is liable to be placed in jeopardy…”", "Stating that it is “inconceivable” that the Budget session would not be convened, the Bench said, “We can only hope that mature constitutional statesmanship would ensure that such instances do not occur in the future as much as we reiterate our expectation that constitutional functionaries must be deeply cognisant of the public trust in the offices which they occupy.

One “beat-the-heat” solution put forth by scientists at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is to advance the time of sowing.", "Wheat is a typically a 140-145 days crop planted mostly in November – before the middle of the month in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (post the harvesting of paddy, cotton and soyabean) and the second half and beyond in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (after sugarcane and paddy). If sowing can be preponed and taken up from around October 20, the crop isn’t exposed to terminal heat, with much of the grain-filling being completed by around the third week of March. It can, then, be comfortably harvested by the month-end.", "But the solution is easier said than done – for the simple reason that the wheat sown before early-November is also prone to premature flowering.", "“The crop seeded in the first half of November normally takes 80-95 days to come to heading (i.e. for the ‘baali’, or earheads bearing the flowers and eventually grain, to fully emerge from the wheat tillers). But if you sow in October, heading is cut short by 10-20 days and occurs in 70-75 days.

In this case, the crop, when sown in October 20-25, will come to heading only in 100-110 days. Adding another 4-5 days for pollination, it leaves a long window from mid-February for grain formation and filling.", "Maximum temperatures should ideally be in the early-thirty degrees range during the 30-40 days when the kernels are formed, take in nutrients from the stems and leaves, and ripen after hardening and drying. The early-sown IARI varieties not only have a longer window for grain development, but also for vegetative stage growth between germination and flowering. “By not heading early despite early sowing, the new varieties are able to accumulate more biomass along with grain weight,” Yadav pointed out. And they can beat the heat.", "The IARI scientists have developed three varieties, all of them incorporating genes that are responsible for the mild vernalisation requirement preventing premature flowering and early heading.", "The first, HDCSW-18, was released and officially notified in 2016. Although having a potential wheat yield of over 7 tonnes per hectare – as against 6-6.5 tonnes for existing popular varieties such HD-2967 and HD-3086 – its plants grew to 105-110 cm. Being tall, compared to 90-95 cm for normal high-yielding varieties, made them prone to lodging or bending over when their earheads were heavy with well-filled grains.", "The second variety HD-3410, released in 2022, has higher yield potential (7.5 tonnes/hectare) with lower plant height (100-105 cm).", "But it’s the third one, HD-3385, which looks most promising. With the same yields as HD-3410, plant height of just 95 cm and strong stems, it is least lodging-prone and most amenable for early sowing.

OPS has been in effect since independence when there was widespread illiteracy and little manufacturing of goods. In today’s perspective, OPS is not just for monetary benefit, it works as a social security. It is a human approach. Through OPS, people get an assured income every month.

We saw the condition of our employees and thought that OPS would not add any burden. Will 1.36 lakh employees retire in just one day? On the one hand, we are giving Rs 1,500 to people over the age of 60. Then how can we not give to employees saying that we have given them a lump sum? There needs to be uniformity.

But Himachal does not have a Joshimath-like situation.", "Jobs are announced every year. For those who joined in 2004, their 30-year liability will be in 2034. Accordingly, it will change with the number of years worked. We declared OPS by keeping a few things in mind.

Himachal is a 97 per cent Hindu state but still the Congress’ ideology defeated the BJP’s Hindutva ideology. This is also the home state of BJP president JP Nadda and Union Minister Anurag Thakur. Union Home Minister Amit Shah did rallies here. Why then could we defeat them? Because the people understand that the performance of a government cannot be judged on the basis of religion. People of Himachal assess performance indices of candidates, find out their behaviour and check if someone is corrupt or not. The electorate here is the most literate, more than in Kerala. It is a politically awakened state as 59 per cent of women have won in the Panchayat Raj elections. I came from the National Student Union of India (NSUI).

Therefore, Congress leaders asked her to lead the campaign from the front. She refused at first but when we put pressure on her, she agreed to campaign. She had a vital role in this victory. National leaders mobilise cadres. The kind of response her first campaign in Solan got made us decide that she should campaign more. She conducted 10 rallies and the Congress won in all the constituencies she went to. She is very enthusiastic about the issues of each constituency, meets the common man. She met about 20 people outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office and told them she would get back the Old Pension Scheme.", "Rahul Gandhi’s ideology surprised the BJP. An ideology comes from leadership. Rahul Gandhi took this thought process to the people through his padayatra.", "Several people leave due to differences of opinion but the ideology never dies.

The government claims that terrorist violence incidents and killing of security personnel in J&K have reduced by almost 50 per cent since August 5, 2019, compared with the same period before it. “Since the August 5, 2019 decisions, violence in the Valley has steadily reduced. Stone pelting has almost vanished and the law-and-order situation is largely under control. However, a large presence of the Indian Army in the hinterland would sit oddly with claims of normalcy,” a Union home ministry official said.", "Political parties in J&K as well as some wings of the government have been pushing for a complete withdrawal of the Army. This has gathered momentum in recent months with many in the government impressing upon the political leadership that the claims of normalcy may be followed with action such as the phased removal of Army from the Valley’s districts.", "According to another government official, the ideal situation, as discussed during the deliberations, would be to hand over the mantle of counter-terror operations in the hinterland to ", " and Kashmir Police.", "“However, at the moment the Union Territory police force is not being viewed as fully prepared and having the wherewithal to replace the Army on its own. So, the idea is to have J&K Police along with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) fill in for the Army when it is withdrawn. They have also demonstrated over the years their capability in Srinagar where the Army is not present. The details of it, in terms of how many more CRPF personnel would be required for this and how the entire command structure will function, is being worked out,” the official said.", "Sources in the security establishment said that in the discussions it was proposed that the Army be withdrawn in a phased manner. “May be the Army can be withdrawn first from a couple of districts such as Anantnag and Kulgam. Following this, the situation on the counter-terror front and the response of the people would be assessed. Depending upon the results, further steps towards more withdrawals would be taken. That’s how it was done when the Border Security Force (BSF) was withdrawn from hinterland Kashmir in the mid-2000s,” another official said.", "The official said that one proposal discussed is to remove the Rashtriya Rifles (RR) of the Indian Army in three phases and replace them with CRPF. The RR, set up in 1990, with a mandate to conduct counter-terror operations in the Valley hinterland, never had a permanent mandate, the official said.", "Another official, privy to details of the discussions, said as of now the Army is only talking about decreasing the strength and not removing RR completely. The Army, according to defence sources, is already planning a resizing.", "“They (RR) are affiliated to various infantry units. By continuing to deploy them for such long periods in internal security duties, you are bleeding the Army units. Army is meant for major tactics and battles. RR has been excellent in the Valley. But time has come to send it back to its core duties,” the official said.", "The Army, defence sources said, is already working on resizing the Rashtriya Rifles. The plan is to reduce the 63 battalions of RR by two companies each (each RR has six companies now). It is being discussed if one force headquarters (five in all) and a few sector headquarters (total of 15) of RR can also be reduced, even as the drawdown plan is yet to be finalised. This could add up to over 15,000 troops.", "Counter-terror operations in the Kashmir Valley are carried out by the Indian Army with the support of CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police. Since the onset of militancy in the Valley, the Army has had a primary role in not just stopping infiltration at the border but also thwarting terror attacks and eliminating militants inside Kashmir through the creation of Rashtriya Rifles in 1990. It did this with J&K Police and the BSF till 2004-05 and has been supported by the CRPF and local police since. Also, in Srinagar, all counter-terror operations since 2005 have been carried out by CRPF and J&K Police, with the RR being kept out."]},

He said that despite a setback in August last year, the team worked hard to make the changes suggested by the review committees and came up with “five new hardware and new separation system” in five months.", "The summary of the report of a failure analysis committee shows that the intended orbit could not be achieved by the SSLV-D1 mission because of excessive vibrations recorded by the on-board accelerometers during stage 2 separation, which led the on-board system to think that the sensors were faulty. With the system designed to isolate faulty sensors and go into a salvage mode, the last velocity-trimming module was not switched on as per the programming. This led to a shortfall in velocity and the satellites were injected in a highly elliptical orbit that cannot be maintained and they fell into the atmosphere.", "Ravi Chandra Babu, who heads the EOS-07 team, said the requirement for another satellite for the SSLV mission came in as early as September 2022. The team then went through the existing payloads being developed to see which could be the best candidate for the mission, without making many changes. The team identified two payloads – a millimeter wave humidity sounder and a spectrum monitoring system that will provide inputs for future operational missions.", "“All the on-board experiments were unique in nature. Radar monitoring, signal monitoring from aircraft, humidity profile generation, s band interference with the terrestrial network and even one of the instruments gives the best advantage for the next mission,” he said. The mission life of the satellite will be one year."]},

In case of failure of sensors, the system will be able to navigate using NaVIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) data.

What has attracted officials in the Union government about this model is it combines the elements of both the OPS (defined benefit) and the NPS (defined contribution). In doing so, it seeks ‘defined contribution’ from employees every month and offers two options of ‘defined benefit’.", "A senior official in the government said, “The core idea of this model is good, but the Andhra government has deliberately understated the rate of return of the NPS.”", "So, what is the Jagananna government model? It is attractively called the ‘Guaranteed Pension Scheme’ or the GPS. Employees can get a guaranteed pension of 33 per cent of their last drawn salary if they contribute 10 per cent of their basic salary every month which is matched by a 10 per cent contribution by the state government. They can get a guaranteed pension of 40 per cent of their last drawn salary, if they are willing to contribute a higher 14 per cent of their salary every month, which will be matched by 14 per cent government contribution.", "Officials in the state government said the Union Finance Ministry has been sounded out about this model. No formal approval has been sought, since it is not required to. But officials in the Union government said the model “is interesting”, but it needs to be studied in detail.", "The Andhra government may be offering many freebies covering every stakeholder community, but it is clear on its assessment of the OPS – that it is not feasible, and it cannot be implemented. In fact, its calculations show that the state’s budget outflow on account of pension and salaries would be Rs 76,590 crore in 2023, and more than double to Rs 1,85,172 crore in 2040. If OPS is reintroduced, its impact on future generations will be severe, an official observed.", "On the NPS, which the Andhra government refers to as the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS), it paints a dismal picture of what the employees will get as pension. With bank deposit rates in India exhibiting a declining trend and government yields in Western economies continuously dropping, it claims that employees will draw only 20 per cent of their last drawn salary as monthly pension. Comparing the pension payout under its proposed guaranteed scheme with the CPS, the state further claims its GPS would offer a 70 per cent higher monthly pension.", "That the old pension scheme is fiscally unsustainable is a fact; parties are not too sure if its good politics either. That’s where the Jagan model is finding resonance: it acknowledges states can’t get back to the old, and yet takes a bold leap that a guarantee, even if not 50 per cent of salary, may be possible.", "Officials in the Union government and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority pointed out that the return under NPS is about 9.5 per cent or so, and that the average monthly pension for government employees under the NPS could be at least 40 per cent of their last drawn salary. “Yes, it may not be 50 per cent guaranteed, but this can be addressed innovatively,” said an official, who did not wish to be named.", "The innovation, officials said, could come in the form of the Central government making up for the 10 per cent gap between the returns under NPS and the earlier defined benefit pension scheme or the OPS. “This is a possible solution,” said the official. This may also be possible by increasing the quantum of monthly contribution by the government under the New Pension Scheme.", "For instance, the Central government had, with effect from April 1, 2019, hiked its contribution towards pension to 14 per cent of their basic salary from 10 per cent. The contribution by employees remained at 10 per cent only. This was, however, resented by those who joined the government between January 2004 and March 2019 since their pension corpus would not grow as much as for those who joined the government from and after April 1, 2019.", "Officials in the Union government said, the Centre can further hike its part of the contribution to the pension fund such that the end benefits come to around 50 per cent of the last drawn salary, assuming returns from NPS of about 9-10 per cent over a 30-year period. “This is all loud thinking now,” said another official, and could catch the political leadership’s attention close to the ", " polls.", " "]},

So we are left clutching our test tubes. But that said, obviously the status of science has, in some ways, fallen in the eyes of people. Science itself has dug itself into a hole. Its language has become inaccessible and complicated in a way it wasn’t before. There was a very provocative article in Nature magazine that tried to distinguish between two kinds of ideas in science, one, which they call consolidative, and another, which they call disruptive. Consolidated ideas take vast bodies of knowledge and condense them into something. Disruptive science is quite the opposite. It starts off afield anew. You can apply this metric to economics, social sciences, philosophy, architecture, and art, among others. But the nice thing about science is that you can actually quantify it. Their hypothesis is that if science is truly disruptive, then the first mention of that discovery — let’s take Einstein’s general theory of relativity — is preceded by nothing. It arises sui generis. Darwin’s theory of evolution arises sui generis. In contrast, consolidative science arises out of the consolidation of prior work. The interesting finding is that over time, contrary to our expectations, the number of truly disruptive papers across all the sciences, including some of the social, quantitative social sciences and economics, has actually been decreasing rather than increasing. Why? They advance a number of hypotheses. The hypothesis that I think is most interesting and most believable, is that science is architecturally organised, in a trunk-and-stem manner. In other words, it looks like a tree, rather than what we would call a fireworks manner, which has a centre and lots of things point out of it. Trunk-and-branch architecture has a central stem, and lots of branches come out of it. Science has a trunk-and-stem kind of quality about it, which is that truly disruptive science arises in a trunk-like quality and then moves into multiple branches. The idea is that those trunks are quite rare and in fact, are decreasing.", "I’m not an expert in artificial intelligence but I engage with it quite a lot. I think there are two general phenomena here. One is the so-called AI and the other is called general AI. There’s not a lot of anxiety about artificial intelligence, per se. It’s the general AI that causes a lot of anxiety. Although, I personally think that both should cause anxieties. For instance, the use of AI in surveillance of citizens is obviously a cause of anxiety. Surveillance of political dissidents is a cause of anxiety. The use of AI in warfare, particularly the combination of robotics and AI in warfare, is a cause of anxiety for me and, legitimately, for the general public. There are other aspects of AI, which I think are not only benign, but very useful. For instance, the use of AI in deciphering patterns in medicine — who’s going to get sick. In predicting genetics, understanding biology and cell biology, etc, which cause much less anxiety.", "In many ways, the creation of new organs and organoids, the interface between cells and devices, including potential devices that go into your brain, in the creation of transplants — transplanted cells, transplanted organs — we are creating humans that we haven’t encountered before. We are creating people who, in some old technologies, would be called cyborgs, although they’re not really cyborgs. They are cell-borgs. They are interfaces between cellular therapies and human beings, and, in being so, really sit at the borderlands of the limits of our current technology. In fact, there may be humans walking among us here, who may have had a bone marrow transplant, and are living chimeras. So their bodies are their own bodies, but their blood is being made from someone else’s body. There will be, very soon, people carrying artificial pancreas. To give you one example that you might think is very prosaic: when the first child was born in a petri dish, Louise Brown, born through IVF, there was no such human being in the world born in and conceived in a petri dish. I think we are creating these new humans. They’re much more real. They are among us. They’re much more real than the science fictional new humans. I think they raise many questions and anxieties about who we are, what we do and what our future looks like.", "To some extent, medicine has driven itself to the ground and has not fully been able to convey its power and its tremendous impact on human history. Less than a 100 years ago, the chances of dying in childbirth in certain areas was in the order of 20-30 per cent. Childbirth was a deadly event. The chances that you would die before you were 60 years old, were 70-80 per cent. Lifespans were 40, 50 or 60 years. In the last 50-odd years, we’ve seen an extension of lifespan, well into the 80s in some countries. We’ve seen the oldest humans well into the hundreds to 120s and so forth. There’s been a massive change, mostly effected by changes in hygiene, sanitation, social and behavioural health. But, health nonetheless. Medicine has come to represent not those, what I would call profoundly beneficial changes. I think there’s been a lot of politics at work in the anti-science movement, the anti-vaxxer movement being one. Some of it is the fault of medicine itself, in being unable to convey its value to humans, and some of it has been the politicisation and divisiveness and the use of medicine as a scapegoat for political divisiveness, both in this country and in many countries around the world.", "I think Big Pharma has become the villain, I personally don’t think it is the villain.

I’ll give you one last example of this. All of you must remember the role that Cipla played during the AIDS pandemic at one point of time. In most of Africa, virtually all the AIDS medicines were coming from Cipla until world trade agreements, led by the pharmaceutical lobby, hand-slapped and handcuffed it and essentially monopolised the creation of antiretrovirals.

Secondly, there’s been a lot of political pressure on China to be more transparent in research.", "It’s been explored. But not at the depth that we need to. There isn’t a good longitudinal database of cancer in many of the most polluted areas of the world. We need incidence, mortality data, etc. Now, some of this data exists for asthma, for instance. There is good data for growth retardation and stunting in the context of sanitation and pollution. There isn’t very good data on cancer. So it’s an unfortunate gap.

With a robust revival, sectors like services are facing a huge attrition and, at the same time, because they’re moving towards greater and greater use of sophisticated technology – they are also seeking people with such skills. So, to pay better, is also to pay better for people with the required skills. And that is why the Government of India has, in this Budget, through various different ways, underlined the need for skilling, upskilling and also skilling for the Industrial Revolution 4.0. We have placed specific emphasis (on the last point), because today the world is moving towards greater use of Web 3.

We are spending (a lot of) money and bringing in that kind of training for people to be better paid. So, the government is pushing it from a different supply side readiness. Obviously that will have to be absorbed by the industry.", "The old system is complicated and several requests in the past have been made to simplify it.

Simultaneously, of course, the private sector has come out, the twin balance sheet problem has been addressed, they have deleveraged themselves considerably. Their books of accounts are far more cleaner, neater now. Also with the PLI, China plus one, Europe plus one, etc, the private sector is now seeing the virtue of moving fast on this track.", "Since data comes in with a lag, how much expansion has happened, how much of newer investments have happened, it’s going to take a while for us to compute. In the meantime, we cannot sit back and watch. So I’m not even getting into that terrain where you’re saying that it (private sector investment) may not happen this year also and, therefore, would you want to go on with the government expenditure…I’m single-mindedly going on this ground that this is a golden opportunity for India.

All of them are moving but moving in their own domains…To be fair to them, I think it’s (their) transition not just to invest more, it’s also a transition to invest like how more? Is it going to be with more technology, is it going to be with industry 4.0, how much of investment is going to come in through robotics or AI?

They are making sure they are putting (in) some things…which is going to take them that far. It is unlike any previous decade when companies invested to expand. It is also investing in transition, so naturally it takes time.", "That is why…one of the things they say is that we need manpower. We need manpower, also because you talk of jobs and all. What kind of manpower? The kind of manpower which can get into that technology enhancement which is happening in my office. But for that I can’t employ him and then train him because I’m already looking at various different aspects of transitioning into high technology. If there are people who have got appropriate skills, I’m willing to pay them any amount, but I can’t settle for somebody who doesn’t have that technology or skill sets and then bring him here, train him, also invest in his training and then also the transition.

It’s the same rural employed, those who are coming to demand (jobs) in the MNREGA.

First of all, with Russia, it’s not a dependence, it’s a choice. And a choice that we have made keeping India’s interest above everything else.

There should be an attempt to bring negotiation as a path towards achieving peace. It is important to negotiate, bring dialogue, and bring diplomacy to do their full job. The attempt now should be to bring (the war) to an end. And how do you do that? By not having more war, I would rather have more diplomacy.", "To be fair, India, I think, has never had the advantage of just looking at its interests, forgetting its neighbourhood.

And if you can’t choose, you also have to understand how you are going to be able to have your citizens do their daily jobs, lead their lives and lead them towards prosperity. This has been a challenge for India since 1947. I don’t think that the situation has changed, but surely, because you are (now) able to convey a lot more to friends who are far off or friends who are near and also in institutions, global institutions, India’s voice probably is getting heard better, India’s position is also getting appreciated better.", "It requires a lot of paperwork. We need all the time to come to the market.", "I don’t think so. Globally, everybody’s challenges are increasing and, therefore, there will be a dip in 2023-24. And then again, there’s a sharp rise; even then (it) will be going up compared to anybody else of our size. So this dip is also because of the global uncertainty, which is not relenting at all. The uncertainty is becoming almost systemic. People, however much they are trying, are not able to extricate their economies from it. That’s why this difference. Especially with this Budget, I think it’s going to be completely the global uncertainty rather than what is happening within the country. And for that, like I said, we need to be prepared.", "I don’t think so. The government’s intent was very clear. It put its time and investment into it in terms of the way in which consultations happened; it was formulated, went through committees and then went through the process of legislation. The government’s commitment and its intent on reforms is intact. But the fact remains that many of those, who supported it earlier, reneged… When you make noise on the streets, but you’re not able to argue in Parliament, and you create obstruction with an absolutely well-knit disinformation campaign… Governance is also about working together with people however much anybody would campaign against us. I’m very clear on all the three, that the positions of people (who opposed) have been hypocritical and undermined elected representatives’ decision-making in Parliament.", "I strongly believe we will come. There’s just no case against this government, however, much the Opposition screams about Bharat jodo Bharat todo, whatever be the name of the campaigns. If there is a strong argument against this government, I’m yet to hear a voice. I’m not undermining the Opposition. Let them please come out. But I’ve not heard a substantial argument to say, no, this government can’t continue, except that we don’t like Prime Minister Modi’s face. You can’t continue with negative politics. Tell us what is it, tell us where we are going. And then appeal to the people saying that’s not happening, it’s going wrong, and therefore I’m the solution for it. That’s not there. So I would love the Opposition to do the Opposition’s job and then claim whatever they want. At the moment, they are running away."]},

The evidence is expected to be used to draft a state-level policy framework on migration and welfare of migrant workers in Jharkhand in the upcoming fiscal year 2023-24,” Arindam Banerjee, founding partner at Policy and Development Advisory Group (PDAG), said.", "PDAG is part of a consortium that signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the state government in October 2021 to design, build and implement the SRMI, including setting up a technical support unit for “evidence-based informed policy making”, said officials in the state’s Labour department.", "One of the key aims listed in the MoU is to “integrate findings from the field survey to help design appropriate state policies to address welfare issues of migrant workers in the state”.", "Kunal Singh, Research Lead at PDAG, said the enumerators will also undertake a “qualitative assessment”, speaking to community leaders and government representatives, “to check last-mile service delivery and understand how safe migration is being facilitated”.", "“In terms of the nature of questions, we have divided them into several blocks, such as knowing household characteristics, understanding the outgoing and incoming of migrants or both, and understanding the push and pull factors, and their quality of life. Then, we are trying to know the remittance savings or its utilisation and the engagement of women within the house or their opinion on the nature of work sought,” Singh said.", "According to official data, tribal communities form nearly 27 per cent of Jharkhand’s population. Officials said this segment is “affected by low human development indicators” and forms a significant chunk of the “huge outflow of the working age population”.", "“The return of migrant workers to the state during the first Covid wave laid bare deeper policy challenges of social welfare, food security, livelihood and health management. Jharkhand also acts as a major source state of migration to far-flung regions like Ladakh, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh as well as Andaman & Nicobar Islands,” a Labour department official told The Indian Express.", "Jharkhand is not the only state to conduct migrant labour surveys. Kerala has been a pioneer in this field, with several such surveys, followed by states like Tamil Nadu and Punjab. “But there is a basic difference in labour movement between Kerala and Jharkhand. In Kerala, workers mostly go abroad, mainly to Gulf countries. In Jharkhand, the issue is internal migration,” another official said.", "Official sources said the ongoing stand-off with the Border Roads Organisation, over the welfare and safety of migrant workers from the state employed in BRO projects, was another reason that pushed the government to frame a policy. “The survey has started in that direction,” an official said."]},
