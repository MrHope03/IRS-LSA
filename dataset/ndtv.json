            "The Indian Space Research Organisation said it successfully carried out an \"extremely challenging\" controlled re-entry experiment of the decommissioned orbiting Megha-Tropiques-1 (MT-1) satellite on Tuesday.",
            "\"The satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and would have disintegrated over the Pacific Ocean\", the Bengaluru-headquartered national space agency said on Twitter.",
            "The final impact region estimated is in the deep Pacific Ocean within the expected latitude and longitude boundaries, an ISRO statement said.",
            "The low Earth satellite was launched on October 12, 2011, as a joint satellite venture of ISRO and the French space agency, CNES for tropical weather and climate studies.",
            "Since August 2022, the satellite's perigee was progressively lowered through a series of 20 manoeuvres spending about 120 kg of fuel.",
            "Multiple manoeuvres including the final de-boost strategy were designed after taking into consideration several constraints, including visibility of the re-entry trace over ground stations, ground impact within the targeted zone, and allowable operating conditions of subsystems, especially the maximum deliverable thrust and the maximum firing duration constraint on thrusters.",
            "All manoeuvre plans were screened to ensure that there would be no post manoeuvre close approaches with other space objects, especially with the crewed space stations like International Space Stations and the Chinese Space Station, ISRO said.",
            "The final two de-boost burns were executed at 11:02 UTC and 12:51 UTC respectively on March 7 by firing four 11 Newton thrusters on-board the satellite for about 20 minutes each, it said.",
            "The final perigee was estimated to be less than 80 km indicating that the satellite would enter the denser layers of the Earth's atmosphere and subsequently undergo structural disintegration. The re-entry aero-thermal flux analysis confirmed that there would be no surviving large debris fragments.",
            "The entire sequence of events was carried out from the Mission Operations Complex in ISTRAC (ISRO Telemetry, Tracking and Command Network), Bengaluru.",
            "An uninhabited area in the Pacific Ocean between 5°S to 14°S latitude and 119°W to 100°W longitude was identified as the targeted re-entry zone for MT1, weighing about 1000 kg, ISRO said earlier this week.",
            "About 125 kg on-board fuel remained unutilised at its end-of-mission that could pose risks for accidental break-up, an ISRO statement had noted.",
            "This left-over fuel was estimated to be sufficient to achieve a fully controlled atmospheric re-entry to impact the uninhabited location in the Pacific Ocean, ISRO had said.",
            "Controlled re-entries involve deorbiting to very low altitudes to ensure impact occurs within a targeted safe zone.",
            "Usually, large satellites/rocket bodies, which are likely to survive aero-thermal fragmentation upon re-entry, are made to undergo controlled re-entry to limit ground casualty risk.",
            "However, all such satellites are specifically designed to undergo controlled re-entry at end-of-life (EOL).",
            "\"MT-1 was not designed for EOL operations through controlled re-entry which made the entire exercise extremely challenging\", ISRO said.",
            "Furthermore, the on-board constraints of the aged satellite, where several systems had lost redundancy and showed degraded performance, and maintaining subsystems under harsher environmental conditions at much lower than originally designed orbital altitude added to the operational complexities, it said.",
            "Innovative workarounds were implemented by the operations team based on the study, deliberations, and exchanges among the mission, operations, flight dynamics, aerodynamics, propulsion, controls, navigation, thermal, and other sub-system design teams across the ISRO centres, who worked in synergy to surmount these challenges, it said.",
            "Although the mission life of the satellite originally was three years, it continued to provide valuable data services for more than a decade supporting regional and global climate models till 2021, ISRO said.",
            "UN/IADC (Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee) space debris mitigation guidelines recommend deorbiting a LEO (Low Earth Orbit) object at its EOL, preferably through controlled re-entry to a safe impact zone, or by bringing it to an orbit where the orbital lifetime is less than 25 years, according to ISRO.",
            "It is also recommended to carry out \"passivation' of on-board energy sources to minimise the risk of any post-mission accidental break-up, it said.",
            "The orbital lifetime of MT-1 would have been more than 100 years in its 20 deg inclined operational orbit of 867 km altitude, according to ISRO.",
            "\"As a responsible space agency committed to safe and sustainable operations in outer space, ISRO proactively takes efforts for better compliance with the UN/IADC space debris mitigation guidelines on post-mission disposal of LEO objects\", the ISRO statement said."

            "Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking for the unconditional release of senior Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia, arrested in the alleged excise scam of Delhi. The move is a shift from the stand of its ally Congress, which had taken a nuanced view, slamming what it called the misuse of central investigating agencies but avoiding any mention of Mr Sisodia. The Congress had also skipped signing the letter on the alleged misuse of Central agencies signed by eight opposition parties.  ",
            "\"I am saddened and disappointed to note that Thiru Manish Sisodia, the elected Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi has been arrested on trumped up allegations and made to undergo all pain and pressure depriving the constitutional guarantee of Personal Liberty. All the canons of criminal justice system have been thrown to the winds and the due process of law has been abused just for personal satisfaction of a ruling party at the Union,\" read the letter.  ",
            "\"I therefore appeal to you to take all steps to uphold the residual reputation of the Premier Investigating Agencies and Constitutional offices during the last nine years of BJP rule at the Union, especially the office of the Governor and direct the release of Thiru Manish Sisodia unconditionally, who has been arrested by demeaning the due process of law and fundamental principles of our seven decades old Constitution,\" Mr Stalin wrote.  ",
            "The letter signals a big shift in the stance of the ruling DMK. AAP was not invited for the birthday celebrations of Mr Stalin on March 1, which was attended by Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge. Party leaders, though, said that invites were sent \"only to those who were available to join\" that day.  ",
            "On February 28, the DMK had slammed the arrest in a statement issued by senior leader TR Baalu.",
            "\"The Union government is purposefully targeting opposition parties by using investigation agencies. It is saddening to see how BJP is using these agencies like its alliance parties. This is not just against democracy but also against the law,\" Mr Baalu's statement read.  ",
            "\"If BJP doesn't let go of its habit of using CBI and other independent agencies for its political gain, people will give a payback in the upcoming 2024 elections,\" it had added.  ",
            "While the Congress and AAP do not see eye to eye, Mr Stalin and Mr Kejriwal have a good equation. Mr Stalin has visited the model schools and mohalla clinics run by the Delhi government and even invited Mr Kejriwal as the chief guest to launch smart schools."

            "The Milky Way Galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, glimmering star-forming regions, and towering dark clouds of dust and gas. Imaging and cataloguing these objects for the study is a herculean task, but a newly released astronomical dataset known as the second data release of the Dark Energy Camera Plane Survey (DECaPS2) reveals a staggering number of these objects in unprecedented detail. The DECaPS2 survey, which took two years to complete and produced more than 10 terabytes of data from 21,400 individual exposures, identified approximately 3.32 billion objects -- arguably the largest such catalogue compiled to date. Astronomers and the public can explore the dataset here, ANI reported.",
            "This unprecedented collection was captured by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) instrument on the Victor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), a Program of NSF's NOIRLab. CTIO is a constellation of international astronomical telescopes perched atop Cerro Tololo in Chile at an altitude of 2200 meters (7200 feet). CTIO's lofty vantage point gives astronomers an unrivalled view of the southern celestial hemisphere, which allowed DECam to capture the southern Galactic plane in such detail.",
            "DECaPS2 is a survey of the plane of the Milky Way as seen from the southern sky taken at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. The first trove of data from DECaPS was released in 2017, and with the addition of the new data release, the survey now covers 6.5% of the night sky and spans a staggering 130 degrees in length. While it might sound modest, this equates to 13,000 times the angular area of the full Moon.",
            "The DECaPS2 dataset is available to the entire scientific community and is hosted by NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab, which is part of the Community Science and Data Center. Interactive access to the imaging with panning/zooming inside of a web browser is available from the Legacy Survey Viewer, the World Wide Telescope and Aladin.",
            "Most of the stars and dust in the Milky Way are located in its disk -- the bright band stretching across this image -- in which the spiral arms lie. While this profusion of stars and dust makes for beautiful images, it also makes the Galactic plane challenging to observe. The dark tendrils of dust seen threading through this image absorb starlight and blot out fainter stars entirely, and the light from diffuse nebulae interferes with any attempts to measure the brightness of individual objects. Another challenge arises from the sheer number of stars, which can overlap in the image and make it difficult to disentangle individual stars from their neighbours.",
            "Despite the challenges, astronomers delved into the Galactic plane to gain a better understanding of our Milky Way. By observing near-infrared wavelengths, they were able to peer past much of the light-absorbing dust. The researchers also used an innovative data-processing approach, which allowed them to better predict the background behind each star. This helped to mitigate the effects of nebulae and crowded star fields on such large astronomical images, ensuring that the final catalogue of processed data is more accurate.",
            "\"One of the main reasons for the success of DECaPS2 is that we simply pointed at a region with an extraordinarily high density of stars and were careful about identifying sources that appear nearly on top of each other,\" said Andrew Saydjari, a graduate student at Harvard University, a researcher at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian and lead author of the paper. \"Doing so allowed us to produce the largest such catalogue ever from a single camera, in terms of the number of objects observed.\"",
            "\"When combined with images from Pan-STARRS 1, DECaPS2 completes a 360-degree panoramic view of the Milky Way's disk and additionally reaches much fainter stars,\" said Edward Schlafly, a researcher at the AURA-managed Space Telescope Science Institute and a co-author-of-the-paper-describing-DECaPS2-published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement. \"With this new survey, we can map the three-dimensional structure of the Milky Way's stars and dust in unprecedented detail.\"",

            "Scientists have captured radio signals from a galaxy almost 9 billion light-years away from the Earth, space.com reported. This is the first time a signal like this has been received from such a distance.",
            "Scientists detected the signals by a unique wavelength known as a \"21-centimetre line\" or the \"hydrogen line,\" which is reportedly emitted by neutral hydrogen atoms.",
            "\"The astronomical distance over which such a signal has been picked up is the largest so far by a large margin. This is also the first confirmed detection of strong lensing of 21 cm emission from a galaxy\", according to an IISc statement.",
            "The findings have been published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.",
            "Atomic hydrogen is the basic fuel required for star formation in a galaxy. When hot ionised gas from the surrounding medium of a galaxy falls onto the galaxy, the gas cools and forms atomic hydrogen, which then becomes molecular hydrogen, and eventually leads to the formation of stars, it was explained.",
            "\"Therefore, understanding the evolution of galaxies over cosmic time requires tracing the evolution of neutral gas at different cosmological epochs\", the statement said.",
            "Atomic hydrogen emits radio waves of 21 cm wavelength, which can be detected using low-frequency radio telescopes like the GMRT. Thus, 21 cm emission is a direct tracer of the atomic gas content in both nearby and distant galaxies, the PTI report said.",
            "However, this radio signal is extremely weak and it is nearly impossible to detect the emission from a distant galaxy using current telescopes due to their limited sensitivity.",
            "\"Until now, the most distant galaxy detected using 21 cm emission was at redshift z=0.376, which corresponds to a look-back time - the time elapsed between detecting the signal and its original emission - of 4.1 billion years (Redshift represents the change in wavelength of the signal depending on the object's location and movement; a greater value of z indicates a farther object),\" it said.",
            "Using GMRT data, Arnab Chakraborty, a post-doctoral researcher at the Department of Physics and Trottier Space Institute of McGill University, and Nirupam Roy, Associate Professor, the Department of Physics, IISc, have detected a radio signal from atomic hydrogen in a distant galaxy at redshift z=1.29.",
            "\"Due to the immense distance to the galaxy, the 21 cm emission line had redshifted to 48 cm by the time the signal travelled from the source to the telescope,\" says Chakraborty. The signal detected by the team was emitted from this galaxy when the universe was only 4.9 billion years old; in other words, the look-back time for this source is 8.8 billion years.",
            "This detection was made possible by a phenomenon called gravitational lensing, in which the light emitted by the source is bent due to the presence of another massive body, such as an early type elliptical galaxy, between the target galaxy and the observer, effectively resulting in the \"magnification\" of the signal.",
            "\"In this specific case, the magnification of the signal was about a factor of 30, allowing us to see through the high redshift universe,\" explains Roy.",
            "The team also observed that the atomic hydrogen mass of this particular galaxy is almost twice as high as its stellar mass. These results demonstrate the feasibility of observing atomic gas from galaxies at cosmological distances in similar lensed systems with a modest amount of observing time. It also opens up exciting new possibilities for probing the cosmic evolution of neutral gas with existing and upcoming low-frequency radio telescopes in the near future, the statement said.",
            "Yashwant Gupta, Centre Director at NCRA (National Centre for Radio Astrophysics), said, \"Detecting neutral hydrogen in emission from the distant Universe is extremely challenging and has been one of the key science goals of GMRT. We are happy with this new path-breaking result with the GMRT, and hope that the same can be confirmed and improved upon in the future.\"",

            "Changes in Earth's orbit that favored hotter conditions may have helped trigger a rapid global warming event 56 million years ago that is considered an analogue for modern climate change, according to an international team of scientists.",
            "\"The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum is the closest thing we have in the geologic record to anything like what we're experiencing now and may experience in the future with climate change,\" said Lee Kump, professor of geosciences at Penn State. \"There has been a lot of interest in better resolving that history, and our work addresses important questions about what triggered the event and the rate of carbon emissions.\"",
            "The scientists analyzed core samples from a well-preserved record of the PETM near the Maryland coast using astrochronology, a technique for dating sediments against orbital patterns that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years, known as Milankovitch cycles.",
            "They found the shape of Earth's orbit, or eccentricity, and the wobble in its rotation, or precession, favored hotter conditions at the onset of the PETM and that these orbital configurations together may have played a role in triggering the event.",
            "\"An orbital trigger may have led to the carbon release that caused several degrees of global warming during the PETM as opposed to what's a more popular interpretation at the moment that massive volcanism released the carbon and triggered the event,\" said Kump, the John Leone Dean in the College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.",
            "The findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, also indicated the onset of the PETM lasted about 6,000 years. Previous estimates have ranged from several years to tens of thousands of years. The timing is important to understand the rate at which carbon was released into the atmosphere, the scientists said.",
            "\"This study allows us to refine our carbon cycle models to better understand how the planet reacts to an injection of carbon over these timescales and to narrow down the possibilities for the source of the carbon that drove the PETM,\" said Mingsong Li, assistant professor in the School of Earth and Space Sciences at Peking University and a former assistant research professor of geosciences at Penn State who is lead author on the study.",
            "A 6,000-year onset, coupled with estimates that 10,000 gigatons of carbon were injected into the atmosphere as the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide or methane, indicates that about one and a half gigatons of carbon were released per year.",
            "\"Those rates are close to an order of magnitude slower than the rate of carbon emissions today, so that is cause for some concern,\" Kump said. \"We are now emitting carbon at a rate that's 5 to 10 times higher than our estimates of emissions during this geological event that left an indelible imprint on the planet 56 million years ago.\"",
            "The scientists conducted a time series analysis of calcium content and magnetic susceptibility found in the cores, which are proxies for changes in orbital cycles, and used that information to estimate the pacing of the PETM.",
            "Earth's orbit varies in predictable, calculable ways due to gravitational interactions with the sun and other planets in the solar system. These changes impact how much sunlight reaches Earth and its geographic distribution and therefore influence the climate.",
            "\"The reason there's an expression in the geologic record of these orbital changes is because they affect climate,\" Kump said. \"And that affects how productive marine and terrestrial organisms are, how much rainfall there is, how much erosion there is on the continents and therefore how much sediment is carried into the ocean environment.\"",
            "Erosion from the paleo Potomac and Susquehanna rivers, which at the onset of the PETM may have rivaled the discharge of the Amazon River, carried sediments to the ocean where they were deposited on the continental shelf. This formation, called the Marlboro Clay, is now inland and offers one of the best-preserved examples of the PETM.",
            "\"We can develop histories by coring down through the layers of sediment and extracting specific cycles that are creating this story, just like you could extract each note from a song,\" Kump said. \"Of course, some of records are distorted and there are gaps -- but we can use the same types of statistical methods that are used in apps that can determine what song you are trying to sing. You can sing a song and if you forget half the words and skip a chorus, it will still be able to determine the song, and we can use that same approach to reconstruct these records.\""

            "Mosquitoes are known for hunting down their preferred 'human snacks' through CO2 exhalations, body heat, and odour. But, some of us often complain of getting more than our fair share of bites. There are numerous theories on why mosquitoes may prefer some humans over others -- blood type, blood sugar level, being a woman or a child, all without enough credible data.",
            "Vosshall and Maria Elena De Obaldia, a former postdoc in her lab, set out to explore the leading theory to explain varying mosquito appeal: individual odor variations connected to skin microbiota.",
            "According to the study published in the article, \"Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels.\"",
            "They recently demonstrated that fatty acids emanating from the skin may create a heady perfume that mosquitoes can't resist. They published their results in 'Cell'.",
            "\"There's a very, very strong association between having large quantities of these fatty acids on your skin and being a mosquito magnet,\" said Vosshall, the Robin Chemers Neustein Professor at The Rockefeller University and Chief Scientific Officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.",
            "In the three-year study, eight participants were asked to wear nylon stockings over their forearms for six hours a day. They repeated this process on multiple days. Over the next few years, the researchers tested the nylons against each other in all possible pairings through a round-robin style \"tournament.\"",
            "They used a two-choice olfactometer assay that De Obaldia built, consisting of a plexiglass chamber divided into two tubes, each ending in a box that held a stocking. They placed Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes -- the primary vector species for Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya -- in the main chamber and observed as the insects flew down the tubes towards one nylon or the other.",
            "By far the most compelling target for Aedes aegypti was Subject 33, who was four times more attractive to the mosquitoes than the next most-attractive study participant, and an astonishing 100 times more appealing than the least attractive, Subject 19.",
            "The samples in the trials were de-identified, so the experimenters didn't know which participant had worn which nylon. Still, they would notice that something unusual was afoot in any trial involving Subject 33, because insects would swarm towards that sample. \"It would be obvious within a few seconds of starting the assay,\" says De Obaldia. \"It's the type of thing that gets me really excited as a scientist. This is something real. This is not splitting hairs. This is a huge effect.\"",
            "The researchers sorted the participants into high and low attractors, and then asked what differentiated them. They used chemical analysis techniques to identify 50 molecular compounds that were elevated in the sebum (a moisturising barrier on the skin) of the high-attracting participants. From there, they discovered that mosquito magnets produced carboxylic acids at much higher levels than the less-attractive volunteers. These substances are in the sebum and are used by bacteria on our skin to produce our unique human body odour.",
            "To confirm their findings, Vosshall's team enrolled another 56 people for a validation study. Once again, Subject 33 was the most alluring, and stayed so over time.",
            "\"Some subjects were in the study for several years, and we saw that if they were a mosquito magnet, they remained a mosquito magnet,\" says De Obaldia. \"Many things could have changed about the subject or their behaviors over that time, but this was a very stable property of the person.\"",
            "Humans produce mainly two classes of odours that mosquitoes detect with two different sets of odour receptors: Orco and IR receptors. To see if they could engineer mosquitoes unable to spot humans, the researchers created mutants that were missing one or both of the receptors. Orco mutants remained attracted to humans and able to distinguish between mosquito magnets and low attractors, while IR mutants lost their attraction to humans to a varying degree, but still retained the ability to find us.",
            "These were not the results the scientists were hoping for. \"The goal was a mosquito that would lose all attraction to people, or a mosquito that had a weakened attraction to everybody and couldn't discriminate Subject 19 from Subject 33. That would be tremendous,\" Vosshall says, because it could lead to the development of more effective mosquito repellents. \"And yet that was not what we saw. It was frustrating.\"",
            "These results complement one of Vosshall's recent studies, also published in Cell, which revealed the redundancy of Aedes aegypti's exquisitely complex olfactory system. It's a failsafe that the female mosquito relies on to live and reproduce. Without blood, she can't do either. That's why \"she has a backup plan and a backup plan and a backup plan and is tuned to these differences in the skin chemistry of the people she goes after,\" Vosshall says.",
            "The apparent unbreakability of the mosquito scent tracker makes it difficult to envision a future where we're not the number-one meal on the menu. But one potential avenue is to manipulate our skin microbiomes. It is possible that slathering the skin of a high-appeal person like Subject 33 with sebum and skin bacteria from the skin of a low-appeal person like Subject 19 could provide a mosquito-masking effect.",
            "\"We haven't done that experiment,\" Vosshall notes. \"That's a hard experiment. But if that were to work, then you could imagine that by having a dietary or microbiome intervention where you put bacteria on the skin that are able to somehow change how they interact with the sebum, then you could convert someone like Subject 33 into a Subject 19. But that's all very speculative.\"",
            "She and her colleagues hope this paper will inspire researchers to test other mosquito species, including in the genus Anopheles, which spreads malaria, adds Vosshall: \"I think it would be really, really cool to figure out if this is a universal effect.\""

Formed from the oldest stars in our galaxy, cool white dwarfs provide information on the formation and evolution of planetary systems around the oldest stars in the Milky Way.\"",

            "The team at Pennsylvania State University used an off-the-shelf automotive radar sensor and a novel processing approach to reveal this significant security concern.",

            "The radar operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) spectrum, specifically in the bands of 60 to 64 gigahertz and 77 to 81 gigahertz, which inspired the researchers to name their approach \"mmSpy.\" This is a subset of the radio spectrum used for 5G, the fifth-generation standard for communication systems across the globe.",
            "In the mmSpy demonstration, described in 2022 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP), the researchers simulated people speaking through the earpiece of a smartphone.",

            "The researchers, including Mahanth Gowda, an assistant professor at Penn State, noted that their approach works even when the audio is completely inaudible to both humans and microphones nearby.",
            "\"This isn't the first time similar vulnerabilities or attack modalities have been found, but this particular aspect -- detecting and reconstructing speech from the other side of a smartphone line -- was not yet explored,\" Basak said.",
            "The radar sensor data is pre-processed via MATLAB and Python modules, which are computing platform-language interfaces used to remove hardware-related and artefact noise from the data.",
            "The researchers then feed that to machine learning modules trained to classify speech and reconstruct audio.",
            "When the radar senses vibrations from a foot away, the processed speech is 83 per cent accuracy. That drops the farther the radar moves from the phone, down to 43 per cent accurate at six feet, they said.",
            "Once the speech is reconstructed, the researchers can then filter, enhance or classify key words as needed, Basak said.",
            "The team is continuing to refine their approach to better understand not only how to protect against this security vulnerability, but also how to exploit it for good.",
            "\"The methodology that we developed can also be used for sensing vibrations in industrial machinery, smart home systems and building-monitoring systems,\" Basak said.",
            "According to the researchers, there are similar home maintenance or even health monitoring systems that could benefit from such sensitive tracking.",

            "The amount of energy released in this 'mega-earthquake' is estimated at 1023 joules, which is about 50,000 times more energy than was released in the magnitude 9.1 Sumatra earthquake in 2004.",
            "Hermann Bermudez will present evidence of this \"mega-earthquake\" at the upcoming GSA Connects meeting in Denver this Sunday, 9 October.",
            "Earlier this year, with support from a GSA Graduate Student Research Grant, Bermudez visited outcrops of the infamous Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction event boundary in Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi to collect data, supplementing his previous work in Colombia and Mexico documenting evidence of the catastrophic impact.",
            "In 2014, while doing fieldwork on Colombia's Gorgonilla Island, Bermudez found spherule deposits -- layers of sediment filled with small glass beads (as large as 1.1 mm) and shards known as 'tektites' and 'microtektites' that were ejected into the atmosphere during an asteroid impact.",
            "These glass beads formed when the heat and pressure of the impact melted and scattered the crust of the Earth, ejecting small, melted blobs up into the atmosphere, to then fall back to the surface as glass under the influence of gravity.",
            "The rocks exposed on the coast of Gorgonilla Island tell a story from the bottom of the ocean -- roughly 2 km down. There, about 3,000-km southwest from the site of the impact, sand, mud, and small ocean creatures were accumulating on the ocean floor when the asteroid hit.",
            "Layers of mud and sandstone as far as 10-15 meters below the sea floor experienced soft-sediment deformation that is preserved in the outcrops today, which Bermudez attributes to the shaking from the impact.",
            "Faults and deformation due to shaking continue up through the spherule-rich layer that was deposited post-impact, indicating that the shaking must have continued for the weeks and months it took for these finer-grained deposits to reach the ocean floor. Just above those spherule deposits, preserved fern spores signal the first recovery of plant-life after the impact.",
            "Bermudez explains, \"The section I discovered on Gorgonilla Island is a fantastic place to study the K-Pg boundary, because it is one of the best-preserved and it was located deep in the ocean, so it was not affected by tsunamis.\"",
            "Evidence of deformation from the mega-earthquake is also preserved in Mexico and the United States. At the El Papalote exposure in Mexico, Bermudez observed evidence of liquefaction -- when strong shaking causes water-saturated sediments to flow like a liquid.",
            "In Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, Bermudez documented faults and cracks likely associated with the mega-quake. He also documents tsunami deposits at several outcrops, left by an enormous wave that was part of the cascading catastrophes resulting from the asteroid collision."

            "Global warming is one of the major concerns in today's time. The rising temperatures of the planet and their adverse effects on life on Earth have triggered to slow down or reverse climate change. Now, climate change has doubled the likelihood of extreme ocean warming near Japan.",
            "According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, SSTs in August 2020 in the southern region of Japan and the northwest Pacific Ocean reached previously unheard-of heights (JMA), reported ANI.",
            "The record-high northwestern Pacific SST seen in August 2020 could not be anticipated to occur without human-induced climate changes, according to a recent study that was released in January 2021.",
            "Since then, the JMA has once more reported that record-breaking SSTs were seen close to Japan in July and October 2021 as well as from June to August 2022. However, it is still unknown how much climate change has affected the possibility that these regional extreme warming episodes would occur.",
            "\"Impacts of global warming are not uniform, rather show regional and seasonal differences,\" said a co-author Hideo Shiogama, the head of the Earth System Risk Assessment Section at Earth System Division, NIES. \"A comprehensive analysis of regional SSTs for a long period may provide a quantitative understanding of how much ocean condition near Japan has been and will be affected by global warming. This better informs policymakers to plan climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.\"",
            "The study, which was published in Geophysical Research Letters, examines the role that global warming plays in the distinct monthly intense ocean warming events that occur in Japan's marginal seas and that, in the preindustrial age, might have happened less frequently than once every 20 years.",
            "The Japan Sea, East China Sea, Okinawa Islands, Taiwan's east coast, and the Pacific shores of Japan were among the ten monitoring zones that the JMA uses in its daily operations. With the exception of the area east of Hokkaido, the scientists confirmed that the observed SST variations between 1982 and 2021 were accurately simulated by 24 climate models taking part in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6sixth )'s phase.",
            "In order to determine the contribution, exceptional ocean warming occurrences were then discovered in nine monitoring regions.",
            "\"In the present climate, every extreme ocean warming event is linked to global warming,\" said corresponding lead author Michiya Hayashi, a research associate at NIES. The scientists estimated the occurrence frequencies of each event in the present and preindustrial climate conditions from January 1982 through July 2022 based on the CMIP6 climate models.",
            "\"We found that the occurrence probability of almost all the extreme ocean warming events has already at least doubled since the 2000s than the preindustrial era. It is increased more than tenfold in sizeable cases since the mid-2010s, especially in southern Japan.\"",
            "For instance, the extreme ocean warming episodes in July 2022 are identified as the anomalously high SSTs detected in five monitoring areas, including the Japan Sea (Areas 1, 3), East China Sea (Areas 5, 8), and south of Okinawa near Taiwan (Area 10).",
            "\"We estimate that, in all of these identified events in July and August 2022, the occurrence frequencies are increased at least doubled due to climate change, and more than tenfold for those in the south of 35 Degrees N except for the north of East China Sea,\" stated Hayashi.",
            "\"Climate change impacts on extreme ocean warming events in northern Japan began to emerge relatively late compared to southern Japan,\" noted Shiogama. The increased global aerosol emissions until the 1980s tend to cool the Earth's surface, which is more substantial in the North Pacific especially near northern Japan via atmospheric large-scale circulation changes. In addition, the year-to-year natural variability of SST is large in northern Japan so the global warming signal was less detectable than in southern Japan. Since in the last decades global aerosol emissions have been reduced, the cooling effect becomes less dominant to human-induced greenhouse gas warming.",
            "\"Our study indicates,\" continued Shiogama, \"that the contribution of climate change to SST extremes has been already discernible beyond natural variability even in northern Japan under the present climate condition.\""

            "Japan will cease to exist if it can't slow a fall in its birth rate that threatens to wreck the social safety net and economy, according to an adviser to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.",
            "\"If we go on like this, the country will disappear,\" Masako Mori said in an interview in Tokyo after Japan announced on Feb. 28 the number of babies born last year slumped to a record low. ",
            "\"It's the people who have to live through the process of disappearance who will face enormous harm. It's a terrible disease that will afflict those children,\" she added. ",
            "Last year, about twice as many people died as were born in Japan, with fewer than 800,000 births and about 1.58 million deaths. An alarmed Kishida has vowed to double spending on children and families in a bid to control the slide, which is progressing even faster than forecast. ",
            "The population has fallen to 124.6 million from a peak of just over 128 million reached in 2008, and the pace of decline is increasing. Meanwhile the proportion of people 65 or over rose to more than 29% last year. While South Korea has a lower fertility rate, Japan's population is shrinking faster. ",
            "\"It's not falling gradually, it's heading straight down,\" said Ms Mori, an upper house lawmaker and former minister who advises Kishida on the birthrate problem and LGBTQ issues. \"A nosedive means children being born now will be thrown into a society that becomes distorted, shrinks and loses its ability to function.\" ",
            "If nothing's done, the social security system would collapse, industrial and economic strength would decline and there wouldn't be enough recruits for the Self-Defense Forces to protect the country, she added. ",
            "While reversing the slide now would be extremely difficult due to the fall in the number of women of child-bearing age, the government must do everything it can to slow the plunge and help mitigate the damage, Ms Mori said. ",
            "Mr Kishida has yet to announce the content of his new spending package, but has said it will be \"on a different dimension\" from previous policies. So far he's mentioned increasing child allowances, improving childcare provision and changing working styles.",
            "But critics contend throwing money at families who have children is not enough to address the problem. A paper from a government panel on gender equality said comprehensive changes are needed that include reducing the burden on women of raising children and making it easier for them to participate in the workforce after giving birth. ",
            "Ms Mori criticized what she said was a tendency to think about the issue separately from finance, trade, and particularly from female empowerment. ",
            "\"Women's empowerment and birth rate policies are the same,\" she said. \"If you deal with these things separately, it won't be effective.\""

Being a judge has given her the ability to see and do what's best and I can't think of anyone better to have that responsibility.” Mehta, a resident of Concord, started her career in civil work, before becoming a prosecutor with the Middlesex District Attorney's Office, where she served for more than a decade.",

Although the universe has hundreds of these discs, it has been challenging to observe genuine planetary birth and development in these settings.",

We matched both groups very closely in terms of their demographic, social and clinical characteristics. We then assessed the relative differences in the reporting of 115 symptoms to GPs. For those who had COVID, we measured this at least 12 weeks after they were infected.",

            " for long COVID.",
            "Some of these symptoms were expected, like loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath and fatigue. But some of the symptoms that we found to be strongly associated with COVID beyond 12 weeks were surprising and less well known, such as hair loss and reduced libido. Other symptoms included chest pain, fever, bowel incontinence, erectile dysfunction and limb swelling.",
            "These differences in symptoms reported between the infected and uninfected groups remained even after we accounted for age, sex, ethnic group, socioeconomic status, body mass index, smoking status, the presence of more than 80 health conditions, and past reporting of the same symptom.",
            "We also found that younger age, female sex, belonging to certain ethnic minority groups, lower socioeconomic status, smoking, obesity, and a wide range of health conditions were all associated with a higher risk of reporting persistent symptoms more than 12 weeks after COVID infection.",
            "Given the ",

Exploring how long COVID symptoms are different in different groups could help scientists understand the different disease processes in the body that cause long COVID.",
            "Our analysis suggests that long COVID can be characterised into three distinct groups based on clusters of symptoms reported. The largest group, consisting of roughly 80% of people with long COVID in our study, faced a broad spectrum of symptoms, ranging from fatigue, to headache, to pain. The second largest group, representing 15%, predominantly had mental health and cognitive symptoms, including depression, anxiety, brain fog and insomnia. The third and smallest group, capturing the remaining 5%, had mainly respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough and wheeze.",
            "We were only able to assess symptoms reported during GP consultations. Of course, not everyone will report symptoms to a doctor, so our study was restricted to comparing the differences in symptoms reported between people with and without a history of confirmed COVID. It's also possible some patients in the comparison group had COVID, but either didn't get tested or didn't notify their GP.",
            "Nonetheless, our research validates what people with long COVID have been saying right through the pandemic about the breadth and diversity of their symptoms. It also reinforces that their symptoms cannot simply be attributed to other factors such as ",

I don't want my future decisions to be shaped by this very year as what I opt to study now will remain with me lifelong,\" Pratyusha told PTI. ",

            "Similarly, for the students in northeast Delhi, the wait for the exams has become a \"test of patience\" as they were postponed first in the area due to law and order situation, and later due to the coronavirus outbreak, resulting in a four-month-long wait for the exams. ",

            "While Islamic State is a shadow of the group that ruled over a third of Syria and Iraq in a Caliphate declared in 2014, hundreds of fighters are still camped in desolate areas where neither the US-led coalition nor the Syrian army, with support from Russia and Iranian-backed militias, exert full control.",

            "But the mission, which former President Donald Trump nearly ended in 2018 before softening his withdrawal plans, is remnant of the larger global war against terrorism that had included once the war in Afghanistan and a far larger US military deployment to Iraq.",
            "Asked by reporters traveling with him if he believed the Syria deployment of roughly 900 US troops to Syria was worth the risk, Milley tied the mission to the security of the United States and its allies, saying: \"If you think that that's important, then the answer is 'Yes.'\"",
            "\"I happen to think that's important,\" Milley said.",
            "\"So I think that an enduring defeat of ISIS and continuing to support our friends and allies in the region ... I think those are important tasks that can be done.\"",

            "US officials believe drone and rocket attacks are being directed by Iran-backed militia, a reminder of the complex geopolitics of Syria where Syrian President Bashar al-Assad counts on support from Iran and Russia and sees US troops as occupiers.",

            "The al-Hol camp houses around more than 50,000 people, including Syrians, Iraqis and other nationals who fled the conflict, and McFarlane estimated around 600 babies were born there every year.",

In a federal lawsuit filed last month, the duo detailed their terrifying ordeal. They were among 44 passengers embarking for Sail Maui's Lanai Coast snorkel tour. ",
            "In their lawsuit, the couple stated the captain informed everyone abroad that the boat would remain anchored in the location for about an hour before moving on to the next location. Throughout the excursion, passengers returned to the boat at different times, the lawsuit said. However, when the couple started to make their way back to the boat about an hour later, the water started to get choppy and they started to swim more aggressively towards the boat. ",
            "But after about 15 minutes of swimming, the couple realised that they \"still had not made progress towards the boat\". \"At approximately 12:20 p.m., after another 15 minutes (approx.) of aggressive swimming, the Vessel was clearly farther from Plaintiffs than it was at the last time they had checked,\" the suit said. ",
            "According to",
            ", once the couple realised that the boat had left, they tried to keep afloat and make distress signals, but eventually ended up in even deeper, choppier water. The duo \"were beginning to panic and were struggling to swim in the ocean conditions,\" they said in their lawsuit. \"They feared that drowning was imminent,\" the suit added. ",
            "However, the pair was eventually able to make it to the shore of Lanai. But the lawsuit noted that they were dehydrated and fatigued. They received help from a resident on the island, who gave them water and let them use their phones. ",
            "Ms Webster then called the snorkelling company and tried to tell the crew that they had gone missing on the tour, but the crew member allegedly told the passenger that they had made it back. The lawsuit also accused the crew of miscounting everyone who had returned from snorkelling. It stated that the company conducted three headcounts, but still never realised that the pair was missing until it was too late. ",
            "Now, Elizabeth Webster and her husband, Alexander Burckle, are suing the Maui Sail Company for $5 million for negligence and emotional distress. "

            "The so-far unexplained illnesses have affected hundreds of schoolgirls in recent months. Iranian officials believe the girls may have been poisoned and have blamed Tehran's enemies.",
            "The country's health minister has said the girls have suffered \"mild poison\" attacks and some politicians have suggested the girls could have been targeted by hardline Islamist groups opposed to girls' education.",
            "Sickness affected more than 30 schools in at least 10 of Iran's 31 provinces on Saturday. Videos posted on social media showed parents gathered at schools to take their children home and some students being taken to hospitals by ambulance or buses.",

            "After a decade of meticulous measurements, scientists announced Thursday that a fundamental particle -- the W boson -- has a significantly greater mass than theorised, shaking the foundations of our understanding of how the universe works.",
            "Those foundations are grounded by the Standard Model of particle physics, which is the best theory scientists have to describe the most basic building blocks of the universe, and what forces govern them.",
            "The W boson governs what is called the weak force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature, and therefore a pillar of the Standard Model.",
            "However new research published in the Science journal said that the most precise measurement ever made of the W Boson directly contradicts the model's prediction.",
            "Ashutosh Kotwal, a physicist at Duke University who led the study, told AFP that the result had taken more than 400 scientists over 10 years to scrutinise four million W boson candidates out of a \"dataset of around 450 trillion collisions\".",
            "These collisions -- made by smashing particles together at mind-bending speeds to study them -- were done by the Tevatron collider in the US state of Illinois.",
            "It was the world's highest-energy particle accelerator until 2009, when it was supplanted by the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva, which famously observed the Higgs boson a few years later.",
            "The Tevatron stopped running in 2011, but the scientists at the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) have been crunching numbers ever since.",
            "Harry Cliff, a particle physicist at Cambridge University who works at the Large Hadron Collider, said the Standard Model is \"probably the most successful scientific theory that has ever been written down\".",
            "\"It can make fantastically precise predictions,\" he said. But if those predictions are proved wrong, the model cannot merely be tweaked.",
            "\"It's like a house of cards, you pull on one bit of it too much, the whole thing comes crashing down,\" Cliff told AFP.",
            "The standard model is not without its problems.",
            "For example, it doesn't account for dark matter, which along with dark energy is thought to make up 95 percent of the universe. It also says that the universe should not have existed in the first place, because the Big Bang ought to have annihilated itself.",
            "On top of that, \"a few fissures have recently been exposed\" in the model, physicists said in a companion Science article.",
            "\"In this framework of clues that there are missing pieces to the standard model, we have contributed one more, very interesting, and somewhat large clue,\" Kotwal said.",
            "Jan Stark, physicist and director of research at the French CNRS institute, said \"this is either a major discovery or a problem in the analysis of data,\" predicting \"quite heated discussions in the years to come\".",
            "He told AFP that \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\".",
            "The CDF scientists said they had determined the W boson's mass with a precision of 0.01 percent -- twice as precise as previous efforts.",
            "They compared it to measuring the weight of a 350-kilogram (800-pound) gorilla to within 40 grams (1.5 ounces).",
            "They found the boson was different than the standard model's prediction by seven standard deviations, which are also called sigma.",
            "Cliff said that if you were flipping a coin, \"the chances of getting a five sigma result by dumb luck is one in three and a half million\".",
            "\"If this is real, and not some systematic bias or misunderstanding of how to do the calculations, then it's a huge deal because it would mean there's a new fundamental ingredient to our universe that we haven't discovered before,\" he said.",
            "\"But if you're going to say something as big as we've broken the standard model of particle physics, and there's new particles out there to discover, to convince people of that you probably need more than one measurement from more than one experiment.\"",
            "CDF co-spokesperson David Toback said that \"it's now up to the theoretical physics community and other experiments to follow up on this and shed light on this mystery\".",
            "And after a decade of measurements, Kotwal isn't done yet.",
            "\"We follow the clues and leave no stone unturned, so we'll figure out what this means.\""

            "The study, published in the journal Circulation, reviewed the medical records of patients younger than 21 by using data from 26 paediatric medical centres across the US and Canada.",
            "Of the 139 teens and young adults, ranging from 12 to 20 years of age, researchers identified and evaluated most patients were white (66.2 per cent), nine out of 10 (90.6per cent) were male and median age was 15.8 years.",
            "Nearly every case (97.8 per cent) followed an mRNA vaccine, and 91.4 per cent occurred after the second vaccine dose.",
            "Onset of symptoms occurred at a median of two days following vaccine administration.",
            "Chest pain was the most common symptom (99,3 per cent), fever and shortness of breath each occurred in 30.9 per cent and 27.3 per cent of patients, respectively.",
            "About one in five patients (18.7 per cent) was admitted to intensive care, but there were no deaths, the researchers said, adding most patients were hospitalised for two or three days.",
            "More than three-fourths (77.3 per cent) of patients who received a cardiac MRI showed evidence of inflammation of or injury to the heart muscle, they said.",
            "Nearly 18.7 per cent had at least mildly decreased left ventricular function (squeeze of the heart) at presentation, but heart function had returned to normal in all who returned for follow-up.",

            "The researchers said future studies should follow patients who have suffered vaccine-associated myocarditis over a longer term, since this study examined only the immediate course of patients and lacks follow-up data.",
            "They also acknowledged several important limitations to consider.",
            "The study design did not allow scientists to estimate the percentage of those who received the vaccine and who developed this rare complication, nor did it allow for a risk-benefit ratio examination.",

            "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday said that Moscow has never engaged in playing one country against another but it is \"being tried by some other outside players\" in the context of so-called Indo- Pacific strategy.",
            "\"We never engage in playing any country against any other country but this is, unfortunately, being tried by some other outside players in the context of so-called Indo- Pacific strategy, using Quad, not for economical purpose but trying to militarise it,\" Mr Lavrov said.",
            "It is pertinent to mention that the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, known as the Quad, is a strategic security dialogue between Australia, India, Japan and the United States.",
            "\"The idea promoted by our American friends of ASEAN plus Quad is openly aimed at ruining East Asia Summits. In other words it means East Asia Summits minus China and Russia,\" Mr Lavrov said in a discussion with Observer Research Foundation.",
            "Talking about Russia's relations with India and China, he said that he had good relations with both countries. He further stated that the relations with India are characterized in official documents signed by the two leaders as a \"specially privileged strategic partnership\" which is the only status that was given to any other on paper.",
            "\"We are interested in these two (India-China) great nations to be friends. It was the initiative of my predecessor to create trioka of Russia, China and India which culminated in the BRICS formation. My feeling is that the more they meet, the better,\" Sergey Lavrov added.",
            "Talking about the negotiation with Ukraine, the Russian Foreign Minister said, \"Everyone's asking when Russia is ready to negotiate. Nobody asks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy when he's going to negotiate. Last year, Zelenskyy signed a document making it a criminal offence to negotiate with Russia as long as Putin is present. Can you ask him what he's doing?\"",
            "Mr Lavrov also talked about NATO and the war. He said that Ukraine had said earlier that they will not expand NATO but then they changed their words.",
            "\"Ukraine legally cancelled the MINSK agreement, which is a series of agreements sought to end the Donbas war fought between armed Russian separatist groups and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, that has to do with the Russian language. And when the people who did not accept the coup in the east of Ukraine and in Crimea said, guys, leave us alone, we are not going to follow your policies,\" the Foreign Minister said.",
            "\"And it is the regime that started the war against these people. That's why the Minsk agreements were considered the way to stop this. And it was not very difficult to implement the Minsk agreements. It was about the special status of a small part of the east of Ukraine, much smaller than the territory which is controlled by the Russian army now, much smaller. But they didn't want to do this because the special status to be given to this small territory included the right to use the Russian language. And this in itself was considered a taboo by the Narcist, who took the power in Ukraine through a coup,\" he added."

            "The study, published in the journal BMJ Open, found that patients with delirium tended to be sicker, with more comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes, and appeared to have more severe COVID-related illness.",
            "\"COVID is also associated with a number of other adverse outcomes that tend to prolong hospitalisation and make recovery difficult,\" said study author Phillip Vlisides, from the University of Michigan in the US.",
            "The researchers used patient medical records and telephone surveys following hospital discharge for a group of patients hospitalised in the intensive care unit between March and May 2020. They attempted to identify common threads amongst patients who developed delirium.",
            "The researchers noted that the disease itself can lead to reduced oxygen to the brain as well as the development of blood clots and stroke, resulting in cognitive impairment.",
            "Inflammatory markers were greatly increased in patients with delirium. Confusion and agitation could be a result of inflammation of the brain, they said.",
            "\"Early on in the pandemic, we weren't performing standard delirium prevention protocols like we usually do,\" Mr Vlisides said.",
            "\"A big reason for that is early on in the pandemic in the pre-vaccine era, we had limited personal protective equipment and were trying to limit COVID exposure and disease transmission,\" he added. There was a correlation between the use of sedatives and delirium - patients with delirium were sedated more often and frequently at higher doses.",
            "\"It is common to use IV sedatives in the ICU, particular for patients on a ventilator. However, from talking to nurses, we found that patients with severe COVID were inherently more delirious and agitated at baseline, perhaps prompting more sedative use,\" said Mr Vlisides.",
            "The study also found that cognitive impairment can persist even after discharge.",
            "Almost a third of patients did not have their delirium marked as resolved in their chart upon leaving the hospital and 40 per cent of these patients required skilled nursing care.",
            "Almost a quarter of patients screened positive for delirium based on assessment by their caretaker. For some patients, these symptoms lasted for months.",
            "This can make managing the recovery process after hospitalisation that much more difficult.",
            "\"Whatever creative ways we can implement in delirium prevention protocols is likely to be very helpful,\" Mr Vlisides said.",
            "\"That includes consistent communication with family members, bringing in pictures and objects from home, and video visits if family cannot safely visit,\" he added.",
            "The take-home message is that for patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19, cognitive impairment - including depression and delirium - is highly likely, he added.",
            "\"Overall, this study highlights another reason why getting vaccinated and preventing severe illness is so important. There can be long term neurological complications that perhaps we don't talk about as much as we should,\" Mr Vlisides said.",

            "SARS-CoV-2 has been responsible for over 227 million infections, and more than 4.6 million deaths worldwide during the pandemic. Efforts to test, treat and vaccinate against the virus all benefit from an improved understanding of the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2.",
            "Both viral and cellular proteases play a crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 replication, and inhibitors targeting proteases have already shown success at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture models.",

            "\"Mass spectrometry-based approaches to identify protease substrates have existed for a number of years however, they have seen only limited application to the study of viral substrates, and had not been previously applied to the study of proteolysis during coronavirus infection,\" explained lead author Dr Emmott Edward, a Tenure-Track Fellow at the University's Institute of Systems, Molecular and Integrative Biology.",
            "The team found previously unknown cleavage sites in multiple viral proteins, including major antigenic proteins S and N, which are the main targets for vaccine and antibody testing efforts.",
            "They discovered significant increases in cellular cleavage events consistent with cleavage by SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) and identified 14 potential high-confidence substrates of the main and papain-like proteases, validating a subset with in vitro assays.",
            "They went on to show that siRNA depletion of these cellular proteins inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, and that drugs targeting two of these proteins: the tyrosine kinase SRC and Ser/Thr kinase MYLK, showed a dose-dependent reduction in SARS CoV-2 titres.",
            "Both Bafetinib (an experimental cancer drug) and Sorafenib (an approved drug used to treat kidney and liver cancer) showed SARS-CoV-2 inhibition at concentrations that did not result in cytotoxicity in a human cell line model of infection.",
            "Dr Emmott said, \"An improved understanding of the exact ways in which proteolytic cleavage is regulated, modulates protein activity, and serves to benefit viral replication will be crucial for targeting cellular substrates of viral proteases as a therapeutic strategy.\"",
            "\"As further SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge, the incorporation of post translational modification data from studies such as this can also support efforts to predict phenotypes from genetic data on emerging variants,\" Dr Emmott concluded."

            "Former US president Donald Trump can be sued by police and others injured in the January 6, 2021 attack by his supporters on the US Capitol, the Justice Department said in a court filing Thursday.",
            "In an official legal opinion submitted to federal court in Washington, the department said although a president has absolute immunity for his official acts in office, he can be sued for acts judged clearly outside of his official duties.",
            "The opinion was submitted at the request of the court, which is hearing a suit by two police officers and 11 lawmakers claiming injury during the January 6 attack.",
            "Trump, who was sued alongside other key actors accused of inciting the attack -- which took place two weeks before he was to leave the White House -- claimed protection from being sued by his absolute immunity.",
            "Trump, the Justice Department said, claimed immunity because his pronouncements up to and during the attack amounted to \"speech on matters of public concern,\" which is within his official duties, even if that speech can be seen as inciting violence.",
            "The Justice Department said the court should reject Trump's categorical argument.",
            "\"As the nation's leader and head of state, the president has 'an extraordinary power to speak to his fellow citizens and on their behalf,'\" the department said.",
            "\"But that traditional function is one of public communication and persuasion, not incitement of imminent private violence,\" it said.",
            "It noted that a president's speech in running for office does not have blanket protection, suggesting that Trump's support for the January 6 mob -- which rejected his loss in the presidential election two months earlier -- might fall in that category.",
            "The department said it was not commenting on the merits of the case -- whether Trump did or did not incite violence -- but only indicated that doing so was not covered by his presidential immunity."

            "The United States has expressed hope that it can work with India to bring an end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said in a press briefing on March 2. He said that India has the ability to speak with moral clarity.",
            "Responding to a question about the role India can play to bring an end to the ongoing conflict, Price said, \"India has the ability we have seen from Prime Minister Modi to speak with tremendous moral clarity. When Prime Minister Modi said last year \"this is not an era of war\", the world listened as they should because when Prime Minister Modi and his country said something to that effect, its meaningful to the United States, it's meaningful to Russia, it is meaningful to countries near and far.\"",
            "\"We will continue to work with our Indian partners they obviously have a unique role to play in this as the G20 host. But, also as a country with whom we have global strategic partnership and a country that has a unique relationship with Russia that we don't and just as India has consistently expressed that this is not and should not be an era of war,\" he added.",
            "He said, \"We hope that we can work closely with India to bring about an end to this war, an end to this Russian aggression to an end that is at its core just endurable and very much in line with the principles in the UN charter.\" Price said that India has longstanding and historical ties with Russia and is connected to Russia in many ways that US is not.\"",
            "Price said that India has ties with Russia that are distinct from the US ties with Moscow. He stressed that India has tremendous leverage in various sectors, including economic, political and moral leverage.",
            "\"There are countries around the world that have a relationship with Russia that is distinct from the one we have, India certainly falls within that category. India has longstanding, historical ties to Russia. It is connected to Russia in ways that United States is not and for that matter has not been. India also has tremendous leverage in different areas whether its economic leverage, diplomatic leverage, political leverage, but also moral leverage,\" Ned Price said.",
            "During his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization's summit in Samarkand last year, PM Modi said, \"Today's era is not of war and I have spoken to you about it on the call.\" Notably, India has consistently called for dialogue to bring an end to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict.",
            "Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday urged his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to reverse Moscow's \"irresponsible decision\" and return to implementing the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treat) nuclear arms reduction treaty.",
            "\"I spoke briefly with Russian FM Lavrov today,\" said Blinken as he confirmed that he met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday on the sidelines of G20 in New Delhi.",
            "\"I urged Russia to reverse its irresponsible decision and return to implementing the New START, which places verifiable limits on the nuclear arsenals of the United States and the Russian Federation. Mutual compliance is in the interest of both our countries. It's also what people around the world expect from us as nuclear powers,\" Blinken added.",
            "He further said, \"I told the foreign minister that no matter what else is happening in the world or in our relationship, the United States will always be ready to engage and act on strategic arms control, just as the United States and the Soviet Union did even at the height of the Cold War.\"",
            "The meeting was the first face-to-face meeting between the two foreign ministers since the conflict between Russia and Ukraine which began over a year ago and triggered a rift between Western countries and Russia. He said that every country continues to bear the cost of Russia's aggression."
