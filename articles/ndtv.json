         "Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that it \"detected the launch of one short-range ballistic missile from the North's western port city of Nampo at 6:20 pm (0920 GMT)\".",
         "It added it was analysing \"the possibility that North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles from the same region simultaneously\".",
         "\"Our military maintains a full readiness posture while closely cooperating with the US as we have strengthened surveillance and vigilance,\" it said.",
         "North Korea has long claimed its nuclear weapons and missile programmes are for self-defence, and has bristled over US-South Korea military exercises, describing them as rehearsals for an invasion.",
         "Earlier this week, North Korea accused the US of \"intentionally\" ramping up tensions, and Kim's powerful sister warned that if the US were to intercept one of Pyongyang's missile tests, it would be seen as a \"clear declaration of war\".",
         "After talks between Kim and then-US president Donald Trump collapsed in 2019, diplomacy has stalled and the North has doubled down on military development.",
         "South Korea's hawkish President Yoon Suk Yeol has moved to boost diplomatic ties and security cooperation with Tokyo and Washington in response to growing threats from Pyongyang.",
         "US President Joe Biden will host Yoon for a state visit on April 26, and the South Korean leader will also visit Tokyo next week, his office said.",
         "This month, the US and South Korean militaries will hold their largest joint drills in five years.",
         "Ahead of those exercises, named \"Freedom Shield\" and scheduled for at least 10 days starting March 13, the allies held air drills this week featuring a nuclear-capable US B-52 heavy bomber.",
         "\"This is likely only the beginning of a series of provocative tests by North Korea,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.",
         "\"Pyongyang is poised to respond aggressively to major US-South Korea defence exercises, as well as to President Yoon's upcoming summits with (Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and US President Joe Biden),\" he said.",
         "\"The Kim regime may order missile firings of longer ranges, attempt a spy satellite launch, demonstrate a solid-fuel engine, and perhaps even conduct a nuclear test.\"",
         "North Korea has framed its missile tests and military drills as justified countermeasures following US-South Korea drills.",
         "Last week, it called on the United Nations to urge a halt to these exercises, and reiterated that its nuclear weapons ensured the balance of power in the region."

If the job is given to the brother today, then in the future the family members or relatives of all those jawans may start putting undue social and family pressure to give the rightful job of them and their children to other family members. Should we create such a difficult situation? The rules made at present have been made on the basis of past experiences only. How can it be justified to snatch the rights of the children of the killed jawans and give jobs to other relatives? What will happen to the children when they become adults? Is it right to take away their rights?\" Ashok Gewhlot had tweeted in Hindi.",
         "Mr Meena this morning went to the SEZ police station in Jaipur and said the government will not be able to suppress the voice of the widows.",
         "\"Why is the government so afraid of 3 women warriors that the police picked them up overnight. Don't know where they have been taken? The women are only pleading to meet the Chief Minister, Ashok Gehlot ji. Why is the Chief Minister so nervous to hear them?\" Mr Meena told reporters."

         "He asked the Central Electricity Authority and the Grid Controller to ensure that prices are reasonable in the HP-DAM and take necessary action to ensure that no Power Producers charge exorbitant prices, which are much more than the cost of production.",
         "Mr Singh launched the portal at a virtual function in New Delhi on Thursday in presence of over 200 stakeholders from state governments and the power sector, the ministry said.",
         "Last year the Ministry of Power, after taking note of the fact that on some days the prices in the electricity exchange had gone up to Rs 20, had given directions to the CERC to put a price cap of Rs 12 on the exchange, so that there is no profiteering, it explained.",

      "content": [
         "More than 171 trillion pieces of plastic are now estimated to be floating in the world's oceans, according to a new study. A team of international scientists analysed records collected between 1979 and 2019 from nearly 12,000 sampling points in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. They found a \"rapid and unprecedented\" increase in ocean plastic pollution since 2005. ",
         "\"Today's global abundance is estimated at approximately 82-358 trillion plastic particles weighing 1.1-4.9 million tonnes. We observed no clear detectable trend until 1990, a fluctuating but stagnant trend from then until 2005, and a rapid increase until the present,\" the study, published on Wednesday in the journal ",
         ", read.  ",
         "Scientists warned that without urgent policy action, the rate at which plastics enter the oceans could increase by around 2.6 times between now and 2040. \"This observed acceleration of plastic densities in the world's oceans also reported for beaches around the globe, demands urgent international policy interventions,\" they wrote.",
         "Speaking to ",
         ", Lisa Erdle, director of research and innovation at the 5 Gyres Institute and an author of the report, explained that only 9% of global plastics are recycled each year. She said that once plastic gets into the ocean, it doesn't decompose but instead tends to break down into tiny pieces. These particles then are \"really not easily cleaned up, we're stuck with them,\" she told the outlet. ",
         "Therefore, figuring out exactly how much plastic is in the ocean is a hard exercise. \"The ocean is a complex place. There are lots of ocean currents, there are changes over time due to weather and due to conditions on the ground,\" Ms Erdle said.",
         "Further, the researchers noted that the highest concentration of ocean plastic is currently in the North Atlantic sea. They said that more data is still needed for areas including the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and the South Atlantic and South Pacific. ",
         "\"This research opened my eyes to how challenging plastic in the ocean is to measure and characterize and underscores the need for real solutions to the problem,\" Win Cowger, a research scientist at Moore Institute for Plastic Pollution Research in California and a study author, said in a statement.",
         "The study also noted that the changing levels of pollution before 2000 may be due to the effectiveness of treaties or policies that govern pollution. In the 1980s several legally-binding international agreements mandated countries to stop discarding fishing and naval plastics in the oceans, as well as to clean up certain amounts. However, as these were followed by voluntary agreements, the authors of the study believe that they may have been less effective and could explain the rise in plastics from around 2000 onwards. ",
         "Now, in their study, the authors have argued that solutions must focus on reducing the amount of plastic produced and used, rather than cleaning up oceans and recycling plastics because this is less likely to stop the flow of pollution.",

         "\"Our position is clear, if you arrive here illegally you will not be able to claim asylum,\" he said.",
         "Opposition Labour Party Leader Keir Starmer countered that the government's proposals as just \"more talk, more gimmicks, more promises to be broken\". But Sunak countered that while he has a clear plan to stop people coming in the first place, Labour has no plan because it does not want to tackle the problem.",
         "\"People must know that if they come here illegally it will result in their detention and swift removal. Once this happens-- and they know it will happen-- they will not come, and the boats will stop,\" said Sunak.",
         "\"We will detain those who come here illegally and then remove them in weeks, either to their own country if it is safe to do so, or to a safe third country like Rwanda. And once you are removed, you will be banned-- as you are in America and Australia-- from ever re-entering our country. This is how we will break the business model of the people smugglers; this is how we will take back control of our borders,\" he said.",
         "The British Indian leader has insisted that the new measures are tough but \"necessary and fair\".",
         "The move follows Indian-origin Home Secretary Suella Braverman laying out the government's proposals in the Commons on Tuesday, in an attempt to curb an expected 40,000 people crossing the English Channel this year-- a figure that is significantly higher than the few hundreds making the dangerous crossings a few years ago.",
         "\"It has to stop. By bringing in new laws, I am making it absolutely clear that the only route to the UK is a safe and legal route,\" said Braverman.",
         "If you come here illegally, you won't be able to claim asylum or build a life here. You will not be allowed to stay. You will be returned home if safe, or to a safe third country like Rwanda. It's the only way to prevent people risking their lives and paying criminals thousands of pounds to get here,\" the minister added.",
         "However, Labour's shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, challenged her strategy to say the plans would make \"the problems even worse, and make it more chaotic\" and \"more lives put at risk\". She also accused government ministers of being \"irresponsible\" in their language and argued they had focused on \"gimmicks\" and \"rhetoric\".",
         "Meanwhile, the United Nations refugee agency has described the moves as \"very concerning\" and would block even those with a compelling claim. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) representative to the UK, Vicky Tennant, told the BBC that the measure would break international law.",
         "\"We believe it's a clear breach of the Refugee Convention, and remember even people with very compelling claims will simply not have the opportunity to put these forward,\" she said.",
         "The Refugee Convention, first agreed in 1951, is a multilateral treaty that sets out who qualifies as a refugee and the obligations of signatory states to protect them.",
         "The UK government has insisted the new measures are \"lawful, proportionate and compassionate\".",
         "Under the new law, it will be the Home Secretary's duty \"to remove\" those entering the UK via illegal routes. This will take legal precedence over someone's right to claim asylum-- although there will be exemptions for under-18s, those with serious medical conditions, and some \"at real risk of serious and irreversible harm\".",
         "Any other asylum claims will be heard remotely after removal. The bill also allows for the detention of illegal arrivals without bail or judicial review within the first 28 days of detention, until they can be removed."

         "The government is reviewing the 'safe harbour' clause that absolves social media platforms of liability for users' posts as it prepares a new Digital India Bill to replace the decades-old Information Technology Act, Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has said, according to The Hindu newspaper.",
         "The 'safe harbour' principle in the IT Act, 2000, says \"intermediaries\" on the internet are not responsible for what third parties post on their website.",
         "But now, as part of an overhaul of digital laws, the government is reconsidering the principle, Mr Chandrasekhar, the Minister of State for Electronics and IT, said at a presentation in Bengaluru on Thursday.",
         "In 2021, the government brought in the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules that require platforms to take down posts when asked to do so by the government or when the law requires it.",
         "In other words, The safe harbour protection is \"earned\", the government had said, subject to the platform doing its bit to keep the internet safe and trusted by making sure that the content that is flagged as \"causing user harm\" is no longer hosted on it.",

         " quoted the minister as saying.",
         "\"The draft of the Digital India Act will be firmed up after two more rounds of discussion,\" Mr Chandrasekhar said during a consultation with the stakeholders.",
         "The draft bill is likely to be issued in April and it will be followed up with more rounds of public consultation for about 45-60 days before being placed in parliament for final approval, officials said. Based on the timelines for consultation, the draft bill is likely to be placed before parliament in July.",
         "In what was the minister's first consultation on the planned Digital India Act, he also discussed rules to handle data captured by invasive gadgets like spy glasses and wearable devices.",
         "Mr Chandrasekhar said legislation has to be in place for the next 10 years to catalyse the innovation ecosystem, protect consumers, be future-proof and future-ready.",
         "\"At a time when technology is disrupting so rapidly. There is AI (Artificial Intelligence). There is AI compute, blockchain, there are all types of big disruptive changes underway. That is a time that this legislation has been brought. So this legislation has to be future-ready and it has to be future-proof,\" he said."

         "New research published in the journal ",
         "demonstrates a surprising way to block radiation from the sun. A University of Utah-led study explored the potential of using dust to shield sunlight. In the study, the group of researchers analysed different properties of dust particles, qualities of dust and the orbits that would be best suited for shading Earth. ",
         "Scientists have been considering employing screens or other devices to block just enough of the sun's light — between 1 and 2 per cent — to lessen the impacts of global warming for decades.",
         "The study was led by researchers from the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian and the University of Utah. They looked at the possibility of employing dust to hide sunlight. ",
         "The team found that launching dust from Earth to a way station at the “Lagrange Point” between Earth and the sun would be most effective but would require an astronomical cost and effort.",
         "The team proposes moondust as an alternative, arguing that lunar dust launched from the moon could be a low-cost and effective way to shade the Earth.",
         "“It is amazing to contemplate how moon dust — which took over four billion years to generate — might help slow the rise in the Earth's temperature, a problem that took us less than 300 years to produce,” says study co-author Scott Kenyon of the Center for Astrophysics.",
         "The team of astronomers applied a technique used to study planet formation around distant stars — their usual research focus — to the lunar dust concept. Planet formation is a messy process that kicks up astronomical dust, which forms rings around host stars. These rings intercept light from the central star and re-radiate it in a way that can be detected.",
         "“That was the seed of the idea; if we took a small amount of material and put it on a special orbit between the Earth and the sun and broke it up, we could block out a lot of sunlight with a little amount of mass,” says Ben Bromley, professor of physics and astronomy at the University of Utah and lead author for the study.",
         "According to the team, a sun-shield's overall effectiveness would depend on its ability to sustain an orbit that casts a shadow on Earth. Sameer Khan, Utah undergraduate student and study co-author, led the initial exploration into which orbits could hold dust in position long enough to provide adequate shading.",
         "“Because we know the positions and masses of the major celestial bodies in our solar system, we can simply use the laws of gravity to track the position of a simulated sun shield over time for several different orbits,” says Khan.",
         "Two scenarios were promising. In the first scenario, the authors positioned a space station platform at the L1 Lagrange point, the closest point between Earth and the sun where the gravitational forces are balanced. Objects at Lagrange points tend to stay along a path between the two celestial bodies, which is why the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is located at L2, a Lagrange point on the opposite side of the Earth.",
         "In computer simulations, the researchers shot particles from the platform to the L1 orbit, including the position of Earth, the sun, the moon, and other solar system planets, and tracked where the particles scattered. The authors found that when launched precisely, the dust would follow a path between Earth and the sun, effectively creating shade, at least for a while. The dust was easily blown off course by the solar winds, radiation, and gravity within the solar system. The team concludes that any L1 space station platform would need to create an endless supply of new dust batches to blast into orbit every few days after the initial spray dissipates.",
         "“It was rather difficult to get the shield to stay at L1 long enough to cast a meaningful shadow. This shouldn't come as a surprise, though, since L1 is an unstable equilibrium point,” Khan says. “Even the slightest deviation in the sun-shield's orbit can cause it to rapidly drift out of place, so our simulations had to be extremely precise.”",
         "In the second scenario, the authors shot lunar dust from a platform on the surface of the moon towards the sun. They found that the inherent properties of lunar dust were just right to effectively work as a sun shield. The simulations tested how lunar dust scattered along various courses until they found excellent trajectories aimed toward L1 that served as an effective sun shield.",
         "The results were welcome news, the team says, because much less energy is needed to launch dust from the moon than Earth. This is important because the amount of dust required for a solar shield is large, comparable to the output of a big mining operation here on Earth.",
         "Kenyon says, “It is astounding that the Sun, Earth, and Moon are in just the right configuration to enable this kind of climate mitigation strategy.”",
         "The authors stress that their new study only explores the potential impact of this strategy, rather than evaluate whether these scenarios are logistically feasible.",
         "“We aren't experts in climate change, or the rocket science needed to move mass from one place to the other. We're just exploring different kinds of dust on a variety of orbits to see how effective this approach might be. We do not want to miss a game changer for such a critical problem,” says Bromley.",
         "One of the biggest logistical challenges — replenishing dust streams every few days — also has an advantage. The sun's radiation naturally disperses the dust particles throughout the solar system, meaning the sun shield is temporary and particles do not fall onto Earth. The authors assure that their approach would not create a permanently cold, uninhabitable planet, as in the science fiction story, “Snowpiercer.” "

         "\"It has turned out that nothing had happened in Tamil Nadu. And just look at the people who have been booked and arrested for spreading rumours\", said the JD(U) chief, referring to cases being lodged against a number of BJP leaders by the DMK government in the southern state.",
         "\"So, this is the character of the BJP. Rumour-mongering, and coercion of parties opposed to it, all for electoral gains. But it is making a mistake. People of the country are now conscious enough to see through their designs\", said the JD(U) president, whose party snapped ties with the saffron party less than a year ago.",
         "Asked about the controversy triggered by Rahul Gandhi's remarks abroad, the chief, whose party is now aligned with the Congress, said \"we believe the problems in the country are best discussed on the home soil, which offers a very large stage. We do not think one's own country should be criticised on foreign soil\", The JD(U) national president, however, hastened to add \"we also hold that Rahul Gandhi is well within his rights to express his anxieties about the threats to democracy in India. And the threats are, indeed, real. This is a fact borne out by the Supreme Court's recent judgement on the appointment of Election Commissioners\".",

         "\"Just recall the 2015 assembly polls when these people were very much with the BJP. They performed dismally\", he said referring to the high-decibel elections which saw the NDA being trounced by the 'Mahagathbandhan'(Grand Alliance) that had come into being with Nitish Kumar, RJD chief Lalu Prasad and the Congress joining hands.",
         "He also said that the BJP's 'jod tod' (attempts to split other parties) was at work in Nagaland where the lone JD(U) MLA ended up offering support to the newly formed government of which the saffron party was a part.",
         "\"Since we hold that we can have no relationship with the BJP, we held the Nagaland unit guilty of gross indiscipline and decided to dissolve it. The BJP had earlier broken away our MLAs in Arunachal, too. In Bihar, they wanted to do to us what they had succeeded in doing in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. But we got wind of their plans in time\", alleged Mr Singh, referring to last year's upheaval.",
         "\"The BJP has no scruples. Its sole concern is power. Just look at Meghalaya where they had been accusing the government of being the most corrupt. Now the same dispensation has returned to power and the BJP's top leaders flew down to attend the oath-taking ceremony\", said the JD(U) chief.",
         "\"The BJP has had no achievement to showcase despite having been in power at the Centre for so many years. Everywhere it keeps talking about the Ujjwala Yojana, which has been a failure as expensive gas cylinders make it impossible for beneficiaries to go in for a refill. Another scheme they rave about is the Ayushman Bharat. They should release data of how many people have benefited from the promise of Rs five lakh health insurance cover\", demanded the JD(U) president.",
         "The BJP is also trying to shy away from the demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee to look into allegations against the Adani group which is being accused of the biggest corporate fraud in history, the JD(U) chief said.",
         "\"On the other hand, it keeps harassing its opponents through vindictive use of agencies like CBI, ED and Income Tax department\", he alleged."

These shapes are likely formed by the gravitational tug of a second star orbiting the nebula's 'parent' star, causing the material to expand into a pair of nebular lobes, or 'wings'. Like an expanding balloon, the wings grow over time without changing their original shape, ANI reported.",
         "Yet new research shows that something is amiss in the Butterfly Nebula. When a team led by astronomers at the University of Washington compared two exposures of the Butterfly Nebula taken by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2009 and 2020, they saw dramatic changes in the material within the wings. As they will report on Jan. 12 at the 241st meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle, powerful winds are driving complex alterations of material within the nebula's wings. They want to understand how such activity is possible from what should be a 'sputtering, largely moribund star with no remaining fuel'.",
         "\"The Butterfly Nebula is extreme for the mass, speed and complexity of its ejections from its central star, whose temperature is more than 200 times hotter than the sun yet is just slightly larger than the Earth,\" said team leader Bruce Balick, a UW professor emeritus of astronomy, adding, \"I've been comparing Hubble images for years and I've never seen anything quite like it.\"",
         "The team compared high-quality Hubble images taken 11 years apart to chart the speeds and growth patterns of features within the nebula's wings. The bulk of the analysis was performed by Lars Borchert, a graduate student at Aarhus University in Denmark who participated in this study as a UW undergraduate student.",
         "Borchert discovered roughly half a dozen 'jets' -- beginning about 2,300 years ago and ending 900 years ago -- pushing material out in a series of asymmetrical outflows. The material in the outer portions of the nebula is moving rapidly, at about 500 miles per second, while material closer to the hidden central star is expanding much more slowly, at about a tenth of that speed. Paths of the jets cross one another, forming 'messy' structures and growth patterns within the wings.",
         "The nebula's multi-polar and swiftly changing interior structure is not easy to explain using existing models of how planetary nebulae form and evolve, according to Balick. The star at the centre of the nebula, which is hidden by dust and debris, could have merged with a companion star or drawn off material from a nearby star, creating complex magnetic fields and generating the jets.",
         "\"At this point, these are all just hypotheses,\" said Balick, adding, \"What this shows us is that we don't fully understand the full range of shaping processes at work when planetary nebulae form. The next step is to image the nebular centre using the James Webb Space Telescope since infrared light from the star can penetrate through the dust.\"",
         "Stars like our sun will swell into a red giants and form planetary nebulae someday, expelling carbon and other relatively heavy elements into the interstellar medium to form star systems and planets in the far future. This new research, and other \"time-lapse\" analyses of planetary nebulae, can help illustrate not just how the materials for the star systems of tomorrow will take shape, but also how the building blocks of our own oasis were produced and gathered billions of years ago.",
         "\"It's a creation story that is happening over and over again in our universe,\" said Balick, adding, \"The shaping processes provide key insight into the history and impacts of the stellar activity.\""

         "Turkey's bickering opposition leaders ended months of fierce debate Monday and agreed to name the head of the main secular party as their joint candidate against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in May 14 polls.",
         "A last-ditch deal aimed at averting a split of the opposition vote will see CHP chief Kemal Kilicdaroglu name the popular mayors of Istanbul and Ankara as vice presidents should he end Erdogan's two-decade rule.",
         "\"We would have been eliminated had we split up,\" Kilicdaroglu told huge crowds of cheering supporters after emerging from hours of tense talks.",
         "Erdogan faces the fight of his political life in what many view as Turkey's most consequential election since its birth as a post-Ottoman republic 100 years ago.",
         "The 68-year-old leader needs to overcome the twin hurdles of an economic crisis and that aftermath of a devastating earthquake as he seeks to extend his Islamic style of rule until 2028.",
         "Opinion polls point to a tight race that remains far too close to call.",
         "But Erdogan's task had appeared to become a little easier when one of the main leaders of the six-party opposition alliance walked out of the talks on Friday.",
         "Meral Aksener has argued that Kilicdaroglu -- a soft-spoken 74-year-old from Turkey's long-marginalised Alevi community -- lacked the public appeal to defeat Erdogan in the presidential ballot.",
         "She has instead urged the popular CHP mayors of either Istanbul or Ankara to step into the race.",
         "The two met Aksener on Monday in a make-or-break attempt to bring her nationalist Iyi Party back into the opposition fold.",
         "\"Our nation cannot tolerate a split,\" Ankara mayor Mansur Yavas told reporters after the meeting.",
         "The opposition last united in an effort to unseat Erdogan's allies in municipal elections held in 2019.",
         "Their ability to regain control of Turkey's two main cities shattered Erdogan's aura of invincibility and set the stage for the possible return to power by the party of the secular state's revered founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.",
         "But Kilicdaroglu wanted Yavas and Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu to keep their posts to avoid the threat of handing back control of either city to Erdogan's Islamic-rooted party.",
         "A 12-point text hammered out Monday committed Kilicdaroglu to naming the other five party leaders as vice president for a post-election transition period should he win.",
         "Kilicdaroglu would then appoint the two mayors as vice president \"at a time deemed appropriate by the president\".",
         "Party leaders said Aksener made the two appointments her main condition for rejoining the opposition bloc.",
         "\"The nation won,\" Iyi Party deputy leader Bahadir Erdem tweeted after the announcements.",
         "Analysts viewed the opposition's failure to put aside their differences just two months before the vote as one of the main factors working in Erdogan's favour.",
         "Erdogan's public approval plunged after he unleashed an unusual economic experiment in late 2021 that tried to fight inflation by drastically cutting interest rates.",
         "A resulting currency crisis erased people's savings and pushed the annual inflation rate to an eye-watering 85 percent.",
         "Turkish stocks and eurobonds both rallied on rising investor hopes that the joint candidate will be able to beat Erdogan and restore economic orthodoxy after years of tumult.",
         "Kilicdaroglu is now also expected to hold separate talks with the pro-Kurdish HDP -- parliament's third-largest party -- to see if he can further expand his appeal.",
         "The HDP had been excluded from the opposition talks because of Aksener's more hawkish policy views.",
         "\"We embrace the people's desire for change,\" HDP co-leader Mithat Sancar said after Kilicdaroglu's name was announced.",
         "\"The HDP will do its part.\"",
         "Erdogan's widely praised handling of Russia's invasion of Ukraine helped reverse the slide in his approval rating and set him up with a chance to secure a come-from-behind win.",
         "But a catastrophic earthquake last month that killed more than 46,000 people in Turkey and nearly 6,000 in Syria threatened to doom Erdogan's entire political career.",
         "Erdogan conceded that his government had been slow to respond in the first critical days of the crisis and asked voters to forgive him for rescue delays.",
         "He also brushed aside rumours that he would try to delay the May vote to a more politically favourable date.",
         "\"We are not hiding behind excuses,\" he said last week.",
         "He told a weekly cabinet that he will announce the formal start of the election campaign on Friday."

         "Migraine doesn't just give you a bad headache, it can also have significant impact on daily life. An episode usually occurs in stages and can last for several days. Severe cases can affect a person's ability to work or study. For the first time, scientists have been able to identify how migraine affects the brain. Using ultra-high MRI, researchers from University of Southern California in Los Angeles found that perivascular spaces are unusually enlarged in people who experience migraine, according to Science Alert.",
         "The perivascular spaces are fluid-filled structures around the brain's blood vessels, as per the National Library of Medicine of the US government. The latest findings suggest damage to small blood vessels of the brain, say scientists.",

         "\"Although we didn't find any significant changes in the severity of white matter lesions in patients with and without migraine, these white matter lesions were significantly linked to the presence of enlarged perivascular spaces. This suggests that changes in perivascular spaces could lead to future development of more white matter lesions,\" he added.",
         "The UK's National Health Service (NHS) said that there are several types of migraine: with aura where there are specific signs like seeing flashing lights, without aura (the most common type) where migraine happens without any warning and silent migraine where a patient experiences common symptoms but there is no headache.",
         "In some cases, doctors prescribe pain relievers to manage migraine, but there a lot of research has been going on about the condition, which could open up other avenues of treatment."

         "Permafrost is commonly referred to as permanently frozen soil. In recent decades, researchers have found that permafrost thawing on the Himalayan Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has occurred at twice the global average rate, which is now seriously jeopardizing the stability of the infrastructural development. ",
         "The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a 970,000 square mile area, stretching from Western China to Pakistan, that includes areas of Nepal, India, eastern Tajikistan and southern Kyrgyzstan. ",
         "In the study, researchers predicted that the melting of the permafrost on the Himalayan plateau will result in an increased need for infrastructure repair and replacement, with 38 per cent of roads, 39 per cent of railways and power lines, and 21 per cent of buildings being threatened by permafrost thaw by 2050. ",
         "As per John S Kimball, a systems ecologist at the University of Montana, one primary worry is that permafrost has now become unpredictable and is thawing nearly everywhere in reaction to the rapidly warming climate, which would be rising at more than three times the global typical warming rate throughout high northern latitudes.",
         "Mr Kimball explained a range of negative impacts of permafrost thaw. According to him, at local scales, permafrost melting can lead to an unstable or shifting ground that can damage building foundations, roads, pipelines and other infrastructure. It can also weaken ground to the extent of mass failure, resulting in landslides. These landslides may be serious, devastating houses and other infrastructure while also pouring enormous volumes of dirt and other debris into nearby streams, harming water quality. ",
         "\"Permafrost exposed by the initial landslide event will then thaw at an even greater rate, leading to even more and larger landslides and further soil loss. The landslides can be especially hazardous in mountain landscapes due to the greater terrain relief and steeper slopes,\" Mr Kimbal explained, as per ",
         ". ",
         "Further, as per the researchers, at a regional scale, permafrost thawing throughout the Arctic is leading to extensive dryness of lakes and other bodies of water. In the study, they noted that freshwater alpine lakes as well as glacier and permafrost thaw, especially in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, supply Asia's three longest rivers and serve as a key water supply for around 20% of the planet's population. Therefore, as glaciers and permafrost continue to melt, the lakes, rivers and other water bodies across the Plateau will begin drying out.",
         "On a larger scale, thawing permafrost feeds back into global warming, increasing thaw in other parts of the planet. The positive response cycle of heating and permafrost melting may potentially involve wildfires, which are on the rise in Arctic permafrost soils, as per the study."

         "Astronomers have discovered the closest black hole to Earth- in our cosmic backyard. Black holes are extremely powerful and massive, these star-devouring monsters have a gravitational field so strong that nothing, not even light can escape. By using the International Gemini Observatory, astronomers have uncovered the closest-known black hole to Earth.",
         "This black hole is 10 times as massive as the sun. The astronomers have dubbed it Gaia BH1 and researchers used the Gemini North telescope in Hawai'i, one of the twin telescopes of the International Gemini Observatory, operated by NSF's NOIRLab- reported Scitechdaily.",
         "The portal reported that Gaia BH1 is located about 1600 light-years away in the constellation Ophiuchus. The next nearest known black hole is about 3,000 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros.",
         "So, what sets this new black hole apart from the 20 or so others already identified in our Milky Way galaxy besides its proximity? New York Times reported the black hole is dormant, a silent killer waiting for the currents of space to feed it.",
         "\"Take the Solar System, put a black hole where the Sun is, and the Sun where the Earth is, and you get this system,\" explained Kareem El-Badry, an astrophysicist at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian and the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, and the lead author of the paper describing this discovery.",
         "\"While there have been many claimed detections of systems like this, almost all these discoveries have subsequently been refuted. This is the first unambiguous detection of a Sun-like star in a wide orbit around a stellar-mass black hole in our Galaxy.\"",
         "The few stellar-mass black holes that have been found were revealed by their energising interactions with a companion star, despite the fact that there are probably millions of them roaming the Milky Way Galaxy. Superheated material from a nearby star spirals in toward the black hole, where it produces intense X-rays and material jets. When a black hole is dormant (i.e., not actively feeding), it simply merges into its surroundings.",
         "\"I've been searching for dormant black holes for the last four years using a wide range of datasets and methods,\" said El-Badry. \"My previous attempts -- as well as those of others -- turned up a menagerie of binary systems that masquerade as black holes, but this is the first time the search has borne fruit.\"",
         "Data from the Gaia spacecraft of the European Space Agency were initially examined by the researchers to determine the system's potential presence of a black hole. Gaia captured the minuscule deviations in the star's velocity brought on by a huge invisible object.",
         "El-Badry and his team used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph instrument on Gemini North to study the system in greater detail. This device accurately determined the companion star's orbital period by measuring the companion star's velocity as it circled the black hole. The team identified the central body as a black hole around 10 times as massive as our Sun thanks to the Gemini follow-up observations, which were essential in putting constraints on the orbital velocity and, consequently, masses of the two components in the binary system.",
         "\"Our Gemini follow-up observations confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that the binary contains a normal star and at least one dormant black hole,\" elaborated El-Badry. \"We could find no plausible astrophysical scenario that can explain the observed orbit of the system that doesn't involve at least one black hole.\"",
         "As they only had a small window to conduct their follow-up observations, the team relied not only on Gemini North's excellent observational capabilities but also on Gemini's capacity to deliver data on short notice.",
         "\"When we had the first indications that the system contained a black hole, we only had one week before the two objects were at the closest separation in their orbits. Measurements at this point are essential to make accurate mass estimates in a binary system,\" said El-Badry. \"Gemini's ability to provide observations on a short timescale was critical to the project's success. If we'd missed that narrow window, we would have had to wait another year.\"",
         "The unique configuration of the Gaia BH1 system is difficult to explain using astronomers' current concepts of the evolution of binary systems. The progenitor star, which later evolved into the newly discovered black hole, would have had a mass at least 20 times that of the Sun.",

         "The discovery of a new cataclysmic variable has been published in the journal Nature. The newly discovered system, which the team has tagged ZTF J1813+4251, is a cataclysmic variable with the shortest orbit detected to date. Unlike other such systems observed in the past, the astronomers caught this cataclysmic variable as the stars eclipsed each other multiple times, allowing the team to precisely measure the properties of each star.",
         "The researchers ran simulations of what the system is likely doing today and how it should evolve over the next hundreds of millions of years. They conclude that the stars are currently in transition and that the sun-like star has been circling and \"donating\" much of its hydrogen atmosphere to the voracious white dwarf. The sun-like star will eventually be stripped down to a mostly dense, helium-rich core. In another 70 million years, the stars will migrate even closer together, with an ultrashort orbit reaching just 18 minutes, before they begin to expand and drift apart.",
         "Decades ago, researchers at MIT and elsewhere predicted that such cataclysmic variables should transition to ultrashort orbits. This is the first time such a transitioning system has been observed directly.",

         "An international team of researchers has found new evidence for the possible existence of liquid water beneath the south polar ice cap of Mars.",
         "The results, published in the journal Nature Astronomy, provide the first independent line of evidence, using data other than radar, that there is liquid water beneath Mars' south pole.",
         "The researchers, led by the University of Cambridge with involvement from the University of Sheffield, used spacecraft laser-altimeter measurements of the shape of the upper surface of the ice cap to identify subtle patterns in its height.",
         "They then showed that these patterns match computer model predictions for how a body of water beneath the ice cap would affect the surface.",
         "Their results are in agreement with earlier ice-penetrating radar measurements that were originally interpreted to show a potential area of liquid water beneath the ice.",
         "There has been debate over the liquid water interpretation from the radar data alone, with some studies suggesting the radar signal is not due to liquid water.",
         "\"This study gives the best indication yet that there is liquid water on Mars today because it means that two of the key pieces of evidence we would look for when searching for sub-glacial lakes on Earth have now been found on Mars,\" said Frances Butcher, second author of the study from the University of Sheffield.",
         "\"Liquid water is an essential ingredient for life, although it does not necessarily mean that life exists on Mars,\" Butcher said.",
         "In order to be liquid at such cold temperatures, the resaerchers noted that the water beneath the south pole might need to be really salty, which would make it difficult for any microbial life to inhabit it.",
         "However, it does give hope that there were more habitable environments in the past when the climate was less unforgiving, they said.",
         "Like Earth, Mars has thick water ice caps at both poles, roughly equivalent in combined volume to the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
         "However, unlike Earth's ice sheets which are underlain by water-filled channels and even large subglacial lakes, the polar ice caps on Mars have until recently been thought to be frozen solid all the way to their beds due to the cold Martian climate.",
         "In 2018, evidence from the European Space Agency's Mars Express satellite challenged this assumption.",
         "The satellite has an ice-penetrating radar called MARSIS, which can see through Mars' southern ice cap. It revealed an area at the base of the ice that strongly reflected the radar signal, which was interpreted as an area of liquid water beneath the ice cap.",
         "However, subsequent studies suggested that other types of dry materials, which exist elsewhere on Mars, could produce similar patterns of reflectance if they exist beneath the ice cap.",
         "Given the cold climate conditions, liquid water beneath the ice cap would require an additional heat source, such as geothermal heat from within the planet, at levels above those expected for present-day Mars.",
         "\"The combination of the new topographic evidence, our computer model results, and the radar data make it much more likely that at least one area of subglacial liquid water exists on Mars today, and that Mars must still be geothermally active in order to keep the water beneath the ice cap liquid,\" said Professor Neil Arnold from Cambridge's Scott Polar Research Institute, who led the research.",
         "On Earth, subglacial lakes affect the shape of the overlying ice sheet - its surface topography. The water in subglacial lakes lowers friction between the ice sheet and its bed, affecting the velocity of ice flow under gravity.",
         "This in turn affects the shape of the ice sheet surface above the lake, often creating a depression in the ice surface followed by a raised area further down-flow.",
         "The team, including researchers from the University of Nantes, University College, Dublin, and the Open University, used a range of techniques to examine data from NASA's Mars Global Surveyor satellite of the surface topography of the part of Mars' south polar ice cap where the radar signal was identified.",
         "Their analysis revealed a 10-15 kilometre-long surface undulation comprising a depression and a corresponding raised area, both of which deviate from the surrounding ice surface by several metres.",
         "This is similar in scale to undulations over subglacial lakes here on Earth. The team then tested whether the observed undulation on the surface of the ice could be explained by liquid water at the bed.",
         "They ran computer model simulations of ice flow, adapted to specific conditions on Mars. They then inserted a patch of reduced bed friction in the simulated ice sheet bed where water, if present, would allow the ice to slide and speed up.",
         "The researchers also varied the amount of geothermal heat coming from inside the planet. These experiments generated undulations on the simulated ice surface that were similar in size and shape to those the team observed on the real ice cap surface.",
         "The similarity between the model-produced topographic undulation and the actual spacecraft observations, together with the earlier ice-penetrating radar evidence suggest that there is an accumulation of liquid water beneath Mars' south polar ice cap, the researchers said.",
         "This magmatic activity occurred relatively recently in the subsurface of Mars to enable the enhanced geothermal heating needed to keep the water in a liquid state, they added.",

         "A new research by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Germany has said that if the global temperatures rises beyond 1.5 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, then it may trigger multiple climate tipping points. The study, published in ",
         ", says that even at current levels of global heating, the world is already at risk of passing five dangerous climate tipping points, and risks increase with each tenth of a degree of further warming.  ",
         "The international research team gathered evidence for tipping points, their temperature thresholds, timescales, and impacts from a comprehensive review of over 200 papers published since 2008 when climate tipping points were first rigorously defined. They have increased the list of potential tipping points from nine to sixteen, reported AFP.  ",
         "This research, published ahead of a major conference \"Tipping Points: from climate crisis to positive transformation\" at the University of Exeter (12-14th September), concludes that human emissions have already pushed Earth into the tipping points danger zone. Five of the sixteen tipping points may be triggered at today's temperatures - the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, widespread abrupt permafrost thaw, collapse of convection in the Labrador Sea, and massive die-off of tropical coral reefs. ",
         "\"We can see signs of destabilisation already in parts of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, in permafrost regions, the Amazon rainforest, and potentially the Atlantic overturning circulation as well,\" said the lead author of the study, Davi Armstrong McKay from Stockholm Resilience Centre, University of Exeter, and the Earth Commission. ",
         "Mr Mckay added, \"The chance of crossing tipping points can be reduced by rapidly cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\" ",
         "\"The world is already at risk of some tipping points. As global temperatures rise further, more tipping points become possible.\" he further said. \"The chance of crossing tipping points can be reduced by rapidly cutting greenhouse gas emissions, starting immediately.\" ",
         "Additionally, the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had earlier stated that risks of triggering climate tipping points become high by around 2°C above preindustrial temperatures and very high by 2.5-4°C. ",
         "This new analysis indicates that Earth may have already left a 'safe' climate state when temperatures exceeded approximately 1°C warming. A conclusion of the research is therefore that even the United Nations' Paris Agreement goal to limit warming to well-below 2°C and preferably 1.5°C is not enough to fully avoid dangerous climate change. According to the assessment, tipping point likelihood increases markedly in the 'Paris range' of 1.5-2°C warming, with even higher risks beyond 2°C. ",
         "The study provides strong scientific support for the Paris Agreement and associated efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C, because it shows that the risk of tipping points escalates beyond this level. To have a 50% chance of achieving 1.5°C and thus limiting tipping point risks, global greenhouse gas emissions must be cut by half by 2030, reaching net-zero by 2050. "

         "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has detected signs of water, along with evidence for clouds and haze, in the atmosphere of a hot, puffy gas giant planet orbiting a Sun-like star over a thousand light years away, the US space agency said today.",
         "The observation is the most detailed of its kind to date, demonstrating Webb's unprecedented ability to analyse distant atmospheres, according to NASA. WASP-96 b is one of more than 5,000 confirmed exoplanets in the Milky Way.",
         "Located roughly 1,150 light-years away in the southern-sky constellation Phoenix, it represents a type of gas giant that has no direct analogue in our solar system, it said in a statement.",
         "With a mass less than half that of Jupiter and a diameter 1.2 times greater, WASP-96 b is much puffier than any planet orbiting our Sun. With a temperature greater than 538 degrees Celsius, it is significantly hotter.",
         "WASP-96 b orbits extremely close to its Sun-like star, just one-ninth of the distance between Mercury and the Sun, completing one circuit every three-and-a-half Earth-days, according to NASA.",
         "The combination of large size, short orbital period, puffy atmosphere, and lack of contaminating light from objects nearby in the sky makes WASP-96 b an ideal target for atmospheric observations.",
         "While the Hubble Space Telescope has analysed numerous exoplanet atmospheres over the past two decades, capturing the first clear detection of water in 2013, Webb's immediate and more detailed observation marks a giant leap forward in the quest to characterise potentially habitable planets beyond Earth.",
         "On June 21, Webb's Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) measured light from the WASP-96 system for 6.4 hours as the planet moved across the star.",
         "This resulted in a light curve showing the overall dimming of starlight during the transit, and a transmission spectrum revealing the brightness change of individual wavelengths of infrared light between 0.6 and 2.8 microns.",
         "The light curve confirmed properties of the planet that had already been determined from other observations - the existence, size, and orbit of the planet.",
         "The transmission spectrum revealed the previously hidden details of the atmosphere: the unambiguous signature of water, indications of haze, and evidence of clouds that were thought not to exist based on prior observations.",
         "A transmission spectrum is made by comparing starlight filtered through a planet's atmosphere as it moves across the star to the unfiltered starlight detected when the planet is beside the star.",
         "Researchers are able to detect and measure the abundances of key gases in a planet's atmosphere based on the absorption pattern - the locations and heights of peaks on the graph.",
         "In the same way that people have distinctive fingerprints and DNA sequences, atoms and molecules have characteristic patterns of wavelengths that they absorb.",
         "The spectrum of WASP-96 b is not only the most detailed near-infrared transmission spectrum of an exoplanet atmosphere captured to date, but it also covers a remarkably wide range of wavelengths, including visible red light and a portion of the spectrum that has not previously been accessible from other telescopes, NASA said.",
         "This part of the spectrum is particularly sensitive to water as well as other key molecules like oxygen, methane, and carbon dioxide.",
         "Researchers will be able to use the spectrum to measure the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere, constrain the abundance of various elements like carbon and oxygen, and estimate the temperature of the atmosphere with depth.",
         "They can then use this information to make inferences about the overall make-up of the planet, as well as how, when, and where it formed.",

         "Abused for years by her ex-husband who broke all of her teeth, Marwa has retreated into hiding with her eight children after Taliban commanders tore up her divorce.",
         "Marwa was one of a small number of women who, under the previous US-backed government, were granted a legal separation in Afghanistan, where women have next to no rights and domestic abuse is endemic.",
         "When Taliban forces swept into power in 2021, her husband claimed he had been forced into the divorce and commanders ordered her back to his clutches.",
         "\"My daughters and I cried a lot that day,\" Marwa, 40, whose name has been changed for her own protection, told AFP.",
         "\"I said to myself, 'Oh God, the devil has returned'.\"",
         "The Taliban government adheres to an austere interpretation of Islam and has imposed severe restrictions on women's lives that the United Nations called \"gender-based apartheid\".",
         "Lawyers told AFP that several women have reported being dragged back into abusive marriages after Taliban commanders annulled their divorces.",
         "For months Marwa endured a new round of beatings, locked away in the house, with her hands broken and fingers cracked.",
         "\"There were days when I was unconscious, and my daughters would feed me,\" she said.",

         "In Afghanistan nine in 10 women will experience physical, sexual or psychological violence from their partner, according to the UN's mission in the country.",
         "Divorce, however, is often more taboo than the abuse itself and the culture remains unforgiving to women who part with their husbands.",
         "Under the previous US-backed government, divorce rates were steadily rising in some cities, where the small gains in women's rights were largely limited to education and employment.",
         "Women once blamed their fate for whatever happened to them, said Nazifa, a lawyer who successfully handled around 100 divorce cases for abused women but is no longer permitted to work in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.",
         "As awareness grew, women realised that separating from abusive husbands was possible.",
         "\"When there is no harmony left in a husband and wife relationship, even Islam permits a divorce,\" explained Nazifa, who only wanted to give her first name.",
         "Under the ousted regime, special family courts with women judges and lawyers were established to hear such cases, but the Taliban authorities have made their new justice system an all-male affair.",
         "Nazifa told AFP that five of her former clients have reported being in the same situation as Marwa.",
         "Another lawyer, who did not want to be identified, told AFP she recently witnessed a court case where a woman was fighting against being forcefully reunited with her ex-husband.",

         "\"But in cases of domestic violence or when a husband does not agree to a divorce, then the court is not granting them,\" she said.",
         "A nationwide network of shelters and services that once supported women has almost entirely collapsed, while the Ministry of Women's Affairs and the Human Rights Commission have been erased.",
         "Sana was 15 when she married her cousin, 10 years older than her.",
         "\"He would beat me if our baby cried or the food was not good,\" she said as she prepared tea on a gas stove at a home where she has been living in secret.",
         "\"He used to say that a woman does not have the right to talk.\"",
         "With the help of a free legal service project she won a divorce from her husband in court -- but her relief was shattered when Taliban commanders came knocking.",
         "Threatened with losing custody of her four daughters, she returned to her ex-husband who by then had also married another woman.",
         "She escaped after he announced the engagement of her daughters to Taliban members.",
         "\"My daughters said, 'Mother, we will commit suicide',\" Sana said.",

         "A group of 12 rectal cancer patients showed no signs of a tumour after taking an antibody drug for six months, according to a surprise finding from an ongoing medical trial in the US that experts termed optimistic.",
         "Besides their tumours disappearing completely, none of the participants reported any severe side-effects either, says the research paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine recently.",
         "The patients underwent a series of medical exams - physical, endoscopy, bioscopy, PET scans and MRI scans - and none of the reports showed a tumour.",
         "\"All 12 patients had a clinical complete response, with no evidence of tumour on magnetic resonance imaging,\" the authors of the study said.",
         "\"Longer follow-up is needed to assess the duration of response,\" they added.",

         "MisMatch repair (MMR) deficient cells usually have many DNA mutations that lead to cancer. MMR deficiency is most common in colorectal cancer, other types of gastrointestinal cancer, and endometrial cancer, the Journal said.",
         "Participants of the trial conducted at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York with mismatch repair-deficient stage II or III rectal adenocarcinoma were given the drug every three weeks for six months.",
         "Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that develops in the glands that line our organs.",
         "According to the initial plan, the treatment was to be followed by standard chemotherapy and surgery, and patients who had a clinical complete response would proceed without both.",
         "After at least six months of follow-up, all 12 patients showed a \"clinical complete response\" with no signs of the tumour.",
         "\"These results are cause for great optimism yet these are early days for the trial as well as for the patients who wish to embark on this treatment. This approach cannot supplant current curative multimodality treatment approach,\" said Dr. Nikhil S Ghadyalpatil, senior consultant, medical oncologist and hemato-oncologist at Hyderabad's Yashoda Hospitals.",
         "\"Clinical complete response as an end point used in this study is an imperfect surrogate for long term cure and hence should be interpreted cautiously. We need larger placebo controlled studies with longer follow up in this setting to confidently consider using this approach in routine practice,\" Dr Ghadyalpatil told PTI.",
         "The treatment, the oncologist said, surely provides an early glimpse of a revolutionary approach in rectal cancer patients and authors of this study should be congratulated for this effort.",
         "There have been no similar trials in India so far, he added.",
         "\"Another similar international study with the drug pembrolizumab showed only 70 per cent patients had long term response at three years unlike 100 per cent response in the current study,\" he added.",

         "\"The cost of dostarlimab is not known in India but is expected to be a couple of lakhs per dose,\" he added.",
         "Commenting on the trial, Dr. Hannah K. Sanoff of the North Carolina Cancer Hospital, said the results are optimistic but the treatment procedure used in the study cannot replace the current curative treatment approach.",
         "\"Patients who have a clinical complete response after chemotherapy and radiation therapy have a better prognosis than those who do not have a clinical complete response, yet cancer regrowth occurs in 20 to 30 per cent of such patients when the cancer is managed nonoperatively,\" she wrote in an editorial on the trial.",
         "Whether the results of this small study will be generalisable to a broader population of patients with rectal cancer is also not known, Sanoff said in the editorial printed in the New England Journal of Medicine.",

It can add and remove elements while taking shadows, reflections, and textures into account.” On the website, you can even see the programme in action, by combining different words and telling it the preferred art style, with which to render the images in.",
         "The process with which it does this though, is what has stumped researchers. Taking to Twitter, a computer science PhD student details how an open source AI program has developed a language that only it understands.",
         "When asked to create an image “two farmers talking about vegetables, with subtitles”, the program did so with the image having two farmers with vegetables in their hands talking. But the speech bubble contains a random assortment of letters spelling “Apoploe vesrreaitars vicootes” that at first hand seem like gibberish.",
         "However, once the researchers put one of the “gibberish” words – “vicootes” - back into the system, the DALL-E2 program gives a picture of vegetables. Writing on Twitter, PhD student Giannis Darris explains, “We feed the text \"Vicootes\" from the previous image to DALLE-2. Surprisingly, we get (dishes with) vegetables! We then feed the words: \"Apoploe vesrreaitars\" and we get birds. It seems that the farmers are talking about birds, messing with their vegetables!",

         "The researchers found an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis -- a blood clot in the leg -- up to three months after COVID-19 infection, pulmonary embolism -- a blood clot in the lung -- up to six months, and a bleeding event up to two months.",
         "They also show a higher risk of events in patients with underlying conditions, patients with more severe COVID-19, and during the first pandemic wave compared with the second and third waves.",
         "The researchers from Umea University in Sweden noted that these results support measures to prevent thrombotic events, especially for high risk patients, and strengthen the importance of vaccination against COVID-19.",
         "Using national registries in Sweden, they identified more than one million people with confirmed SARSCoV-2 infection between February 1, 2020 and May 25, 2021, matched by age, sex, and county of residence to more than four million people who had not had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result.",
         "The researchers first calculated the rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding in COVID-19 individuals during a control period -- before and long after COVID-19 diagnosis -- and compared it to the rates in different time intervals after COVID-19 diagnosis.",
         "They then calculated the rates of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and bleeding 1-30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis in the COVID-19 group and compared them to the corresponding rates in the control group.",
         "The results show that compared with the control period, risks were significantly increased 90 days after COVID-19 for deep vein thrombosis, 180 days for pulmonary embolism, and 60 days for bleeding.",
         "After taking account of a range of potentially influential factors, the researchers found a five-fold increase in risk of deep vein thrombosis, a 33-fold increase in risk of pulmonary embolism, and an almost twofold increase in risk of bleeding in the 30 days after infection.",
         "This means that a first deep vein thrombosis occurred in 401 patients with COVID-19 and 267 control patients, the researchers said.",
         "A first pulmonary embolism event occurred in 1,761 patients with COVID-19 and 171 control patients, and a first bleeding event occurred in 1,002 patients with covid-19 and 1,292 control patients, they said.",
         "The researchers found that the risks were highest in patients with more severe COVID-19 and during the first pandemic wave compared with the second and third waves, which they said could be explained by improvements in treatment and vaccine coverage in older patients after the first wave.",
         "Even among mild, non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients, the researchers found increased risks of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.",
         "No increased risk of bleeding was found in mild cases, but a noticeable increase was observed in more severe cases.",
         "This is an observational study, so the researchers cannot establish cause, and they acknowledge several limitations which might have affected their findings.",
         "For example, they said VTE may have been underdiagnosed in patients with COVID-19, testing for the disease was limited, especially during the first pandemic wave, and information on vaccination was not available.",

         "They also found that antibody levels dropped off in the first three months following the second dose but a third 'booster' dose raised levels of antibodies that effectively neutralise the Omicron variant.",
         "The study found that in people who had received the Pfizer vaccine for all three doses, antibody levels against Omicron after a third dose were similar to those previously reached against Delta after only two shots.",
         "Overall, antibody levels were nearly 2.5 times higher against Omicron after three doses compared to after two jabs, according to the researchers.",
         "Higher levels of antibodies against Omicron were also found in people who received two doses of either vaccine and also reported previously having COVID-19 symptoms, compared to those who didn't have disease symptoms in past.",
         "While levels of antibodies alone do not predict vaccine effectiveness, they are a very good indicator of protection against severe COVID-19, the researchers noted.",
         "The study confirms that three doses of COVID-19 vaccine are essential to boost antibodies to quantifiable levels and maximise the amount of protection against severe disease and hospitalisation. \"People who have queued outside vaccinations centres should be reassured that a vaccine booster is the best way of protecting them from Omicron,\" said Emma Wall, an infectious diseases consultant at UCLH Biomedical Research Centre of NIHR.",
         "\"And for people who haven't yet had a booster or even a first dose, it's not too late,\" Emma said in a statement.",

         "The team found that Xevudy (sotrovimab), a recently-approved synthetic monoclonal antibody used to prevent and treat patients at risk of developing severe COVID-19, was able to neutralise the Omicron variant. \"We have really important early data to suggest that at least some versions of synthetic antibodies that we currently use to treat certain patients, are likely to be effective against this new variant,\" Bryan Williams, UCLH Director of Research, added.",
         "David LV Bauer, from Francis Crick Institute, said while Omicron has considerably more mutations than other recent variants, such as Alpha and Delta, the study shows that the boosters push the immune system to make a broad response capable of tackling it.",
         "\"This new variant can overcome the immune blockade put in place by two vaccine doses, but thankfully following the third dose, neutralising activity is robust in the vast majority of people,\" Ms Wall said.",

         "All donor pigs involved in the four known pig-to-human transplants came from a herd from Revivicor, a subsidiary of the biotech company United Therapeutics Corporation. Previous research has found such pig transplants suitable for non-human primates.",
         "According to official US data, there are nearly 107,000 Americans awaiting an organ -- 90,000 of whom need a kidney. Seventeen Americans die each day while waiting for an organ.",

         "Today, pig heart valves are widely used in humans, and pig skin is grafted on human burn victims.",

Indeed, 2021 may well be the coldest year we'll ever experience again. Let's reflect on the year that was, and what we can expect for this year and beyond.",

         "During La Niña we see cool water from deep in the Pacific Ocean rise to the surface. This happens when wind strength increases at the equator, which pushes warmer water to the west and allows more cool water to rise off the coast of South America.",
         "Essentially, the net transfer of energy from the surface to the deeper ocean brings the average global surface temperature down. While La Niña is a natural phenomenon (it's not the result of human activities), human-caused climate change remains a constant underlying influence that sets a long-term warming trend.",
         "The La Niña conditions of 2021 took the edge off the global average surface temperature. Parts of Australia, southern Africa and northwestern North America saw cooler temperatures during 2021 compared to recent years as the effects of La Niña kicked in.",

Another reason is because our major floods are often caused by extreme rain that falls for several days, and the effect of climate change on this type of rain is difficult to unpick.",

         "An international team of researchers investigated vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), also known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a life-threatening condition seen in a very small number of people after receiving the adenovirus vaccines.",
         "\"The mechanism which results in this condition, termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), was unknown,\" said corresponding author of the study Abhishek Singharoy, from Arizona State University, US.",
         "The researchers at Arizona and Cardiff University in the UK worked with AstraZeneca to analyse whether the ultra-rare side effect could be linked to the viral vector which is used in many vaccines, including those from Oxford/AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.",
         "The findings, published in the journal Science Advances, suggest it is the viral vector -- in this case, an adenovirus used to shuttle the coronavirus' genetic material into cells -- and the way it binds to platelet factor 4 (PF4) once injected that could be the potential mechanism.",
         "In very rare cases, the scientists suggest, the viral vector may enter the bloodstream and bind to PF4, where the immune system then views this complex as foreign.",
         "They believe this misplaced immunity could result in the release of antibodies against PF4, which bind to and activate platelets, causing them to cluster together and triggering blood clots in a very small number of people after the vaccine is administered.",
         "Professor Alan Parker, from Cardiff University's School of Medicine, said VITT only happens in extremely rare cases because a chain of complex events needs to take place to trigger this ultra-rare side effect.",
         "\"Our data confirms PF4 can bind to adenoviruses, an important step in unravelling the mechanism underlying VITT. Establishing a mechanism could help to prevent and treat this disorder,\" Mr Parker said.",
         "\"We hope our findings can be used to better understand the rare side effects of these new vaccines - and potentially to design new and improved vaccines to turn the tide on this global pandemic,\" he added.",
         "Both the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines use an adenovirus to carry spike proteins from the coronavirus into people to trigger a protective immune response.",
         "When both vaccines showed the ultra-rare side effect of VITT, scientists wondered whether the viral vector had some part to play.",
         "Another important clue was that neither the Moderna nor Pfizer vaccines, made from an entirely different technology called mRNA vaccines, showed this effect.",
         "The team used cryo-EM technology to flash-freeze preparations of ChAdOx1, the adenovirus used in the AstraZeneca vaccine and bombard them with electrons to produce microscopic images of the vaccine components.",
         "They were then able to look in atomic level at the structure of the outer protein cage of the virus - the viral capsid - and other critical proteins that allow entry of the virus into the cell.",
         "The researchers outlined the details for the structure and receptor of ChAdOx1, which is adapted from chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 - and how it interacts with PF4.",
         "They believe it is this specific interaction - and how it is then presented to the immune system - that could prompt the body's own defences to view it as foreign and release of antibodies against this self-protein.",
         "The team also used the computational models to show that one of the ways the two molecules tightly bind is via electrostatic interactions.",
         "The group showed that ChAdOx1 is mostly electronegative.",
         "This makes the protein act like the negative end of a battery terminal, and could attract other positively charged molecules to its surface.",
         "\"We found that ChAdOx1 has a strong negative charge. This means the viral vector can act like a magnet and attract proteins with the opposite, positive charge, like PF4,\" said study first author Alexander Baker.",
         "\"We then found that PF4 is just the right size and shape that when it gets close to ChAdOx1 it could bind in between the negatively charged parts of ChAdOx1's surface, called hexons,\" Mr Baker said.",
         "The team is hopeful that armed with a better understanding of what may be causing rare VITT they can provide further insights into how vaccines and other therapies, which rely on the same technology, might be altered in the development of the next generation vaccines and therapies.",
         "\"With a better understanding of the mechanism by which PF4 and adenoviruses interact there is an opportunity to engineer the shell of the vaccine, the capsid, to prevent this interaction with PF4,\" said Baker.",

         "The planet, known as a gas giant, is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, with traces of other gases. Stripes and a few storms like the Great Red Spot dominate the colorful appearance of Jupiter, the fifth planet from the sun with a diameter of about 88,850 miles (143,000 km).",
         "The Great Red Spot is a storm roughly 10,000 miles (16,000 km) wide churning in Jupiter's southern hemisphere, boasting crimson-colored clouds that spin counterclockwise at high speeds. It is one of the marvels of the solar system and has been in existence for centuries, but scientists until now have had little understanding of what lies below its surface.",
         "\"From a scientific point of view, it's puzzling how the storm can last so long and be so big,\" said Scott Bolton, principal investigator of the Juno mission at the Southwest Research Institute in Texas and lead author on one of two Jupiter studies published in the journal Science on Thursday.",
         "\"It is wide enough to swallow the Earth,\" added Marzia Parisi, a Juno scientist from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and lead author of the second study.",
         "An instrument called a microwave radiometer enabled scientists to peer beneath Jupiter's cloud tops and investigate the structure of its numerous vortex storms including the Great Red Spot, showing that they exist very deep in Jupiter's atmosphere - much deeper than expected.",
         "Rather than being confined to the uppermost parts of Jupiter's atmosphere, the Great Red Spot's roots plunge to regions beyond where water condenses and clouds form - and below where any sunlight reaches.",
         "Juno data previously showed that jet streams in Jupiter's atmosphere reach down even further, to depths of about 2,000 miles (3,200 km).",
         "Assumptions based on how Earth's atmosphere behaves, as well as models produced over past few decades, had given the impression that the Great Red Spot was a relatively shallow storm, Bolton said.",
         "\"Jupiter works in this mysterious way that we're sort of revealing for the first time - because this is the first mission that's been able to look inside the planet,\" Bolton added. \"And we're seeing surprises.\"",
         "Jupiter and Earth are vastly different worlds, and not just in terms of size. Earth is a rocky place. Jupiter lacks a solid surface though it may have a solid inner core.",
         "Juno has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016, obtaining information about its atmosphere, interior structure, internal magnetic field and the region around it created by its internal magnetism. Juno also is due to fly by Jupiter's large moons Europa and Io and explore the small rings around the planet.",
         "The Great Red Spot has evolved in shape over time and there are indications that it may be shrinking in size.",

         "Hunting for variants requires a concerted effort. South Africa and the UK were the first big countries to implement nationwide ",
         " for SARS-CoV-2 as early as April 2020.",
         "Variant hunting, as exciting as that sounds, is performed through whole genome sequencing of samples that have tested positive for the virus. This process involves checking every sequence obtained for differences compared to what we know is circulating in South Africa and the world. When we see multiple differences, this immediately raises a red flag and we investigate further to confirm what we've noticed.",
         "Fortunately South Africa is well set up for this. This is thanks to a central repository of public sector laboratory results at the ",
         ", (NGS-SA), good linkages to private laboratories, the ",
         ", and state-of-the-art ",
         ".",
         "In addition, South Africa has several laboratories that can grow and study the actual virus and discover how far antibodies, formed in response to vaccination or previous infection, are able to neutralise the new virus. This data will allow us to characterise the new virus.",
         "The beta variant spread much more efficiently between people compared to the “wild type” or “ancestral” SARS-CoV-2 and caused South Africa's second pandemic wave. It was therefore classified as a variant of concern. During 2021, yet another variant of concern called delta spread over much of the world, including South Africa, where it caused ",
         ".",
         "Very recently, routine sequencing by Network for Genomics Surveillance member laboratories detected a new virus lineage, ",
         ", in South Africa. Seventy-seven samples collected in mid-November 2021 in Gauteng province had this virus. It has also been reported in small numbers from neighbouring Botswana and Hong Kong. The Hong Kong case is reportedly ",
         ".",
         "Whether B.1.1.529 will be classified as a variant of interest or of concern, like beta and delta, has not been decided by the World Health Organization yet. We expect that it will be given a Greek name soon.",
         "We do not know for sure. It certainly seems to be more than just the result of concerted efforts to monitor the circulating virus. One theory is that people with highly compromised immune systems, and who experience prolonged active infection because they cannot clear the virus, may be the source of new viral variants.",
         "The assumption is that some degree of “immune pressure” (which means an immune response which is not strong enough to eliminate the virus yet exerts some degree of selective pressure which “forces” the virus to evolve) creates the conditions for new variants to emerge.",
         "Despite an advanced antiretroviral treatment programme for people living with HIV, numerous individuals in South Africa have advanced HIV disease and are not on effective treatment. Several clinical cases have been investigated that support ",
         ", but much remains to be learnt.",
         "The short answer is, we don't know. The long answer is, B.1.1.529 carries certain mutations that are concerning. They have not been observed in this combination before, and the spike protein alone has over 30 mutations. This is important, because the spike protein is what makes up most of the vaccines.",
         "We can also say that B.1.1.529 has a genetic profile very different from other circulating variants of interest and concern. It does not seem to be a “daughter of delta” or “grandson of beta” but rather represents a new lineage of SARS-CoV-2.",
         "Some of its genetic changes are known from other variants and we know they can affect transmissibility or allow immune evasion, but many are new and have not been studied as yet. While we can make some predictions, we are still studying how far the mutations will influence its behaviour.",
         "We want to know about transmissibility, disease severity, and ability of the virus to “escape” the immune response in vaccinated or recovered people. We are studying this in two ways.",
         "Firstly, careful epidemiological studies seek to find out whether the new lineage shows changes in transmissibility, ability to infect vaccinated or previously infected individuals, and so on.",
         "At the same time, laboratory studies examine the properties of the virus. Its viral growth characteristics are compared with those of other virus variants and it is determined how well the virus can be neutralised by antibodies found in the blood of vaccinated or recovered individuals.",
         "In the end, the full significance of the genetic changes observed in B.1.1.529 will become apparent when the results from all these different types of studies are considered. It is a complex, demanding and expensive undertaking, which will carry on for months, but indispensable to understand the virus better and devise the best strategies to combat it.",
         "There is no evidence for any clinical differences yet. What is known is that cases of B.1.1.529 infection have increased rapidly in Gauteng, where the country's fourth pandemic wave ",
         ". This suggests easy transmissibility, albeit on a background of much relaxed non-pharmaceutical interventions and low number of cases. So we cannot really tell yet whether B.1.1.529 is transmitted more efficiently than the previously prevailing variant of concern, delta.",
         "COVID-19 is more likely to manifest as severe, often life-threatening disease in the elderly and chronically ill individuals. But the population groups often most exposed first to a new virus are younger, mobile and usually healthy people. If B.1.1.529 spreads further, it will take a while before its effects, in terms of disease severity, can be assessed.",
         "Fortunately, it seems that all diagnostic tests that have been checked so far are able to identify the new virus.",
         "Even better, it appears that some widely used commercial assays show a specific pattern: two of the three target genome sequences are positive but the third one is not. It's like the new variant consistently ticks two out of three boxes in the existing test. This may serve as a marker for B.1.1.529, meaning we can quickly estimate the proportion of positive cases due to B.1.1.529 infection per day and per area. This is very useful for monitoring the virus's spread almost in real time.",
         "Again, we do not know. The known cases include individuals who had been vaccinated. However we have learnt that the immune protection provided by vaccination wanes over time and does not protect as much against infection but rather against severe disease and death. One of the epidemiological analyses that have commenced is looking at how many vaccinated people become infected with B.1.1.529.",
         "The possibility that B.1.1.529 may evade the immune response is disconcerting. The hopeful expectation is that the high seroprevalence rates, people who've been infected already, found by ",
         " would provide a degree of “natural immunity” for at least a period of time.",
         "Ultimately, everything known about B.1.1.529 so far highlights that universal vaccination is still our best bet against severe COVID-19 and, together with ",
         ", will go a long way towards helping the healthcare system cope during the coming wave."
