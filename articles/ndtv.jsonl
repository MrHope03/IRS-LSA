Forty-five study participants, ages 18 to 21, with no history of heart trouble, were monitored with electrocardiography, or ECG, measuring heart electrical activity at millisecond resolution. The ECG was linked to a computer, which enabled brief tones lasting 80–180 milliseconds to be triggered by heartbeats.

These changes impact how much sunlight reaches Earth and its geographic distribution and therefore influence the climate.", "\"The reason there's an expression in the geologic record of these orbital changes is because they affect climate,\" Kump said. \"And that affects how productive marine and terrestrial organisms are, how much rainfall there is, how much erosion there is on the continents and therefore how much sediment is carried into the ocean environment.\"", "Erosion from the paleo Potomac and Susquehanna rivers, which at the onset of the PETM may have rivaled the discharge of the Amazon River, carried sediments to the ocean where they were deposited on the continental shelf.

But, some of us often complain of getting more than our fair share of bites. There are numerous theories on why mosquitoes may prefer some humans over others -- blood type, blood sugar level, being a woman or a child, all without enough credible data.", "Vosshall and Maria Elena De Obaldia, a former postdoc in her lab, set out to explore the leading theory to explain varying mosquito appeal: individual odor variations connected to skin microbiota.", "According to the study published in the article, \"Differential mosquito attraction to humans is associated with skin-derived carboxylic acid levels.\"", "They recently demonstrated that fatty acids emanating from the skin may create a heady perfume that mosquitoes can't resist. They published their results in 'Cell'.", "\"There's a very, very strong association between having large quantities of these fatty acids on your skin and being a mosquito magnet,\" said Vosshall, the Robin Chemers Neustein Professor at The Rockefeller University and Chief Scientific Officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.", "In the three-year study, eight participants were asked to wear nylon stockings over their forearms for six hours a day. They repeated this process on multiple days. Over the next few years, the researchers tested the nylons against each other in all possible pairings through a round-robin style \"tournament.\"", "They used a two-choice olfactometer assay that De Obaldia built, consisting of a plexiglass chamber divided into two tubes, each ending in a box that held a stocking. They placed Aedes Aegypti mosquitoes -- the primary vector species for Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya -- in the main chamber and observed as the insects flew down the tubes towards one nylon or the other.", "By far the most compelling target for Aedes aegypti was Subject 33, who was four times more attractive to the mosquitoes than the next most-attractive study participant, and an astonishing 100 times more appealing than the least attractive, Subject 19.", "The samples in the trials were de-identified, so the experimenters didn't know which participant had worn which nylon. Still, they would notice that something unusual was afoot in any trial involving Subject 33, because insects would swarm towards that sample. \"It would be obvious within a few seconds of starting the assay,\" says De Obaldia. \"It's the type of thing that gets me really excited as a scientist. This is something real. This is not splitting hairs. This is a huge effect.\"", "The researchers sorted the participants into high and low attractors, and then asked what differentiated them. They used chemical analysis techniques to identify 50 molecular compounds that were elevated in the sebum (a moisturising barrier on the skin) of the high-attracting participants. From there, they discovered that mosquito magnets produced carboxylic acids at much higher levels than the less-attractive volunteers. These substances are in the sebum and are used by bacteria on our skin to produce our unique human body odour.", "To confirm their findings, Vosshall's team enrolled another 56 people for a validation study. Once again, Subject 33 was the most alluring, and stayed so over time.", "\"Some subjects were in the study for several years, and we saw that if they were a mosquito magnet, they remained a mosquito magnet,\" says De Obaldia. \"Many things could have changed about the subject or their behaviors over that time, but this was a very stable property of the person.\"", "Humans produce mainly two classes of odours that mosquitoes detect with two different sets of odour receptors: Orco and IR receptors. To see if they could engineer mosquitoes unable to spot humans, the researchers created mutants that were missing one or both of the receptors. Orco mutants remained attracted to humans and able to distinguish between mosquito magnets and low attractors, while IR mutants lost their attraction to humans to a varying degree, but still retained the ability to find us.", "These were not the results the scientists were hoping for. \"The goal was a mosquito that would lose all attraction to people, or a mosquito that had a weakened attraction to everybody and couldn't discriminate Subject 19 from Subject 33. That would be tremendous,\" Vosshall says, because it could lead to the development of more effective mosquito repellents. \"And yet that was not what we saw. It was frustrating.\"", "These results complement one of Vosshall's recent studies, also published in Cell, which revealed the redundancy of Aedes aegypti's exquisitely complex olfactory system. It's a failsafe that the female mosquito relies on to live and reproduce. Without blood, she can't do either. That's why \"she has a backup plan and a backup plan and a backup plan and is tuned to these differences in the skin chemistry of the people she goes after,\" Vosshall says.", "The apparent unbreakability of the mosquito scent tracker makes it difficult to envision a future where we're not the number-one meal on the menu. But one potential avenue is to manipulate our skin microbiomes. It is possible that slathering the skin of a high-appeal person like Subject 33 with sebum and skin bacteria from the skin of a low-appeal person like Subject 19 could provide a mosquito-masking effect.", "\"We haven't done that experiment,\" Vosshall notes. \"That's a hard experiment. But if that were to work, then you could imagine that by having a dietary or microbiome intervention where you put bacteria on the skin that are able to somehow change how they interact with the sebum, then you could convert someone like Subject 33 into a Subject 19. But that's all very speculative.\"", "She and her colleagues hope this paper will inspire researchers to test other mosquito species, including in the genus Anopheles, which spreads malaria, adds Vosshall: \"I think it would be really, really cool to figure out if this is a universal effect.\""]}

This device accurately determined the companion star's orbital period by measuring the companion star's velocity as it circled the black hole. The team identified the central body as a black hole around 10 times as massive as our Sun thanks to the Gemini follow-up observations, which were essential in putting constraints on the orbital velocity and, consequently, masses of the two components in the binary system.", "\"Our Gemini follow-up observations confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that the binary contains a normal star and at least one dormant black hole,\" elaborated El-Badry. \"We could find no plausible astrophysical scenario that can explain the observed orbit of the system that doesn't involve at least one black hole.\"", "As they only had a small window to conduct their follow-up observations, the team relied not only on Gemini North's excellent observational capabilities but also on Gemini's capacity to deliver data on short notice.", "\"When we had the first indications that the system contained a black hole, we only had one week before the two objects were at the closest separation in their orbits. Measurements at this point are essential to make accurate mass estimates in a binary system,\" said El-Badry. \"Gemini's ability to provide observations on a short timescale was critical to the project's success. If we'd missed that narrow window, we would have had to wait another year.\"", "The unique configuration of the Gaia BH1 system is difficult to explain using astronomers' current concepts of the evolution of binary systems.

At the El Papalote exposure in Mexico, Bermudez observed evidence of liquefaction -- when strong shaking causes water-saturated sediments to flow like a liquid.", "In Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, Bermudez documented faults and cracks likely associated with the mega-quake.

The rising temperatures of the planet and their adverse effects on life on Earth have triggered to slow down or reverse climate change. Now, climate change has doubled the likelihood of extreme ocean warming near Japan.", "According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, SSTs in August 2020 in the southern region of Japan and the northwest Pacific Ocean reached previously unheard-of heights (JMA), reported ANI.", "The record-high northwestern Pacific SST seen in August 2020 could not be anticipated to occur without human-induced climate changes, according to a recent study that was released in January 2021.", "Since then, the JMA has once more reported that record-breaking SSTs were seen close to Japan in July and October 2021 as well as from June to August 2022. However, it is still unknown how much climate change has affected the possibility that these regional extreme warming episodes would occur.", "\"Impacts of global warming are not uniform, rather show regional and seasonal differences,\" said a co-author Hideo Shiogama, the head of the Earth System Risk Assessment Section at Earth System Division, NIES. \"A comprehensive analysis of regional SSTs for a long period may provide a quantitative understanding of how much ocean condition near Japan has been and will be affected by global warming. This better informs policymakers to plan climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.\"", "The study, which was published in Geophysical Research Letters, examines the role that global warming plays in the distinct monthly intense ocean warming events that occur in Japan's marginal seas and that, in the preindustrial age, might have happened less frequently than once every 20 years.", "The Japan Sea, East China Sea, Okinawa Islands, Taiwan's east coast, and the Pacific shores of Japan were among the ten monitoring zones that the JMA uses in its daily operations. With the exception of the area east of Hokkaido, the scientists confirmed that the observed SST variations between 1982 and 2021 were accurately simulated by 24 climate models taking part in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6sixth )'s phase.", "In order to determine the contribution, exceptional ocean warming occurrences were then discovered in nine monitoring regions.", "\"In the present climate, every extreme ocean warming event is linked to global warming,\" said corresponding lead author Michiya Hayashi, a research associate at NIES. The scientists estimated the occurrence frequencies of each event in the present and preindustrial climate conditions from January 1982 through July 2022 based on the CMIP6 climate models.", "\"We found that the occurrence probability of almost all the extreme ocean warming events has already at least doubled since the 2000s than the preindustrial era. It is increased more than tenfold in sizeable cases since the mid-2010s, especially in southern Japan.\"", "For instance, the extreme ocean warming episodes in July 2022 are identified as the anomalously high SSTs detected in five monitoring areas, including the Japan Sea (Areas 1, 3), East China Sea (Areas 5, 8), and south of Okinawa near Taiwan (Area 10).", "\"We estimate that, in all of these identified events in July and August 2022, the occurrence frequencies are increased at least doubled due to climate change, and more than tenfold for those in the south of 35 Degrees N except for the north of East China Sea,\" stated Hayashi.", "\"Climate change impacts on extreme ocean warming events in northern Japan began to emerge relatively late compared to southern Japan,\" noted Shiogama. The increased global aerosol emissions until the 1980s tend to cool the Earth's surface, which is more substantial in the North Pacific especially near northern Japan via atmospheric large-scale circulation changes. In addition, the year-to-year natural variability of SST is large in northern Japan so the global warming signal was less detectable than in southern Japan. Since in the last decades global aerosol emissions have been reduced, the cooling effect becomes less dominant to human-induced greenhouse gas warming.", "\"Our study indicates,\" continued Shiogama, \"that the contribution of climate change to SST extremes has been already discernible beyond natural variability even in northern Japan under the present climate condition.\""]}
