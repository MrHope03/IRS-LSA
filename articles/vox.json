I was on the West Coast with my non-politically obsessed family and a friend, watching Republicans fail to elect Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House 14 times over the course of four days. We weren’t just watching a historic fail unfold (the kind of embarrassment Congress ", "). We were also seeing a confounding stalemate preventing the country from having a fully functioning government.", "Part of my job as a political reporter during this tumultuous week was to understand why this was happening and explain it to the world (", " on Capitol Hill took the lead on this). But Jeff Jackson, a Democrat and incoming first-term representative from North Carolina, was a step ahead of me.  ", "“I told you that the next time you heard from me I would be an official member of Congress, and then something very strange happened, and I’m still not,” he said in a TikTok posted to his 300,000 followers on the penultimate day of the GOP’s speaker fight. Wearing a burgundy tie loosely around his neck, Jackson looked directly into my eyes and told me about the Freedom Caucus, the group of hardline conservatives who held up McCarthy’s speaker bid. “Right now, there is no Plan B. Either these 20 folks cave, which they’ve sworn they won’t do, or the 200 other members of the majority party put up someone else as speaker, which they’ve sworn they won’t do. And nothing happens until this happens, including swearing us in.”", "The whole scene felt very intimate, impressive, and quite informative. The 3 million people who watched this particular video must have felt some of this. And Jackson mentioned his other TikToks. Would they be any different from those of the scores of amateurish news recappers, college students, and aspiring Joe Rogans on political TikTok? ", "I, along with 2 million other people, had already watched that 87-second clip (in it, Jackson describes the “weird process” by which new members of Congress pick offices through a raffle pulled from a “mahogany box that is a century old”). And as I clicked onto his page and kept scrolling, I realized something. Jackson was accomplishing something very different from most politicians: He was not just using TikTok to chronicle his journey from candidate to officeholder; he was actually connecting with people.", "Given the toxic nature of political discourse online, it’s the kind of engagement the average politician can only dream of having.", "“I’m big on reaching people directly,” Jackson told me during a recent interview. “We’re already saturated with people who want to give us the daily talking points or the daily outrage. I don’t need to add to that.”", "Now that he’s officially in Congress, Jackson is a rarity: an elected official posting directly on a Chinese-owned social media app that’s facing the prospect of a national ban and growing security concerns, and that has already been banished from official devices in Congress. TikTok has quickly become a convenient bipartisan punching bag for politicians ", " “China’s backdoor into Americans’ lives.” ", "It wasn’t always this way. Just a few years ago, TikTok was hailed as a potentially huge ", " in ", ", ", ", and ", ", but now Jackson is one of a small group of politicians using TikTok in an official or campaign capacity, and, in another rarity, has mastered the art of the political TikTok.", "It’s happening at a strange moment for American politics and for TikTok. The short video app has never faced as much scrutiny as it has endured during the last year — for its collection, storage, and usage of user data, alleged spying on journalists, and Chinese ownership. The app’s future operation in the US remains in jeopardy, and though a straight ban seems unlikely, a bipartisan consensus is forming in Washington and state capitals that the app poses a national security threat and requires major reform. Its CEO will testify before a House committee in March.", "It’s no surprise, then, that the landscape of political TikTok is fraught. In reporting this story, I reached out to political strategists and about a dozen national elected officials, their campaigns, and their staff. Many, like the White House and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, didn’t reply, while even some of the most well-known Democratic figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t want to talk about the app. ", "Wariness of the platform can mean missing out on a powerful tool. “Especially for Democrats, understand that the bad actors who push misinformation and inflate conspiracy theories are overrunning social media with their content,” Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist and former Republican congressional adviser, told me. “If we aren’t on those channels flooding the zone with an alternative, we are essentially surrendering that playing field to the bad guys.”", "A spokesperson for California Senate candidate Katie Porter, who has almost 500,000 followers between her two official accounts, was positive about the app’s purpose: “Congresswoman Porter has used TikTok to reach thousands of people who may not be on other platforms. She’s called out Big Oil for fueling climate change, exposed Wall Street for hiking prices to earn record-high profits, and showed Californians how to vote by mail.”", "Still, for some politicians, the nebulous specter of a national security risk isn’t enough of a reason to stay off the platform or shun the communities that use the app. Well over 130 million Americans use the platform every month, including about two-thirds of young people, who tend to use it ", ". That has created ", " for those elected officials who invest time and energy into building a presence. The preferred social media app of an entire generation has been mostly unexplored by elected officials — even as some of them try to shut it down. ", "Like any social media platform, TikTok always had the potential to become a gold mine for communicators and politicians who learned how to fit into its culture and use it. Even before the platform took off in 2020 as pandemic shutdowns closed schools and businesses and brought society to a standstill, the app offered virality and social media fame to whoever accepted the lightheartedness and silliness at its core. ", "Since its launch in 2018, comms and PR professionals lauded the app as a “", ",” while some younger journalists and media professionals who had a hunch just how influential the platform would become urged politicians and legacy news organizations to use the app. “I feel it’s my duty to act as a liaison between [Gen Z] and the generations who came before us. So here goes: Old politicians, you need to get on TikTok,” one opinion writer ", ".", "It was around that time that the Washington Post’s TikTok account became what my colleague Rebecca Jennings called an “", "” for Democratic presidential candidates, who until then had resisted using the platform. “Like all social media apps, TikTok has its own vernacular, and any transgressions of that shared language and sensibility stick out like, well, septuagenarian politicians on a social media app meant for teens. The fear of coming off as insincere or being flooded with ‘ok boomer’ comments is a real one,” she wrote at the time. ", "And for those who did try, the early days were rough. Only one candidate, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro, had an official account on TikTok in the early days of the Democratic primary in 2020. At its peak, the account only had about 500 followers, and it rarely featured the candidate himself.", "Other candidates, like Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, and Andrew Yang, simply opted for the Washington Post route: using a middleman to bring themselves to the app. That was also safer politically, avoiding the charge of inauthenticity (Gen Z can sniff out a poser better than a hog finding truffles), or “", "” (essentially, trying too hard).", "But concerns over misinformation and disinformation came hand in hand with the rise of the platform.

That number has grown steadily since, to the estimated 80 million monthly active users of today.", "It was around this time that Christina Haswood, who lives in Lawrence, Kansas, decided she would start using her TikTok account to jump-start her local state House race. The 28-year-old Navajo public health researcher was finishing up a master’s degree at the nearby University of Kansas Medical Center and was the frontrunner in the Democratic primary, and she felt pressure to reach more voters, fund her campaign, and make her Native heritage better known. “It was first kind of a joke. The best thing to pass time with and relieve stress was TikTok,” Haswood told me recently.", "Then she and her campaign manager began to wonder if they could use the app to educate voters about her election. Her first videos pulled in a few thousand views and were primarily informational, like checking your voter registration, requesting a ballot, and preventing the spread of Covid-19.", "But when she joined a Taylor Swift challenge (how do I explain this? TikTokers would ", " or ", " that they pushed away in time with the beat) and she peppered in short lines of text introducing herself, her personal beliefs, and her policy positions, virality took off.

", "Establishment politicians have long viewed the app with caution because of this, and for the past three years, TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, has been in negotiations with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a group of government agencies that reviews foreign corporate transactions for national security risks, for the best way for the company to operate in the US. Recent reporting of misuse of American personal data by the company hasn’t helped TikTok’s case for proving its independence from the Chinese government, or its trustworthiness in light of alleged spying on American journalists. But most federal lawmakers default to saying they are awaiting the Committee’s final recommendation.", "That hasn’t stopped more ham-fisted attempts to try to shut down the app. In 2020, Donald Trump tried to ban TikTok by executive order, sending shockwaves through TikTok communities worried about losing access to the platform. That ban never went into effect, and targeted, mostly symbolic bans have since popped up in individual states, the halls of Congress, and the executive branch. A growing anti-China consensus has also developed into a general aversion by politicians in both political parties to defending the app, and as my colleague Sara Morrison has written, it seems like a matter of time before some ", ".", "Markey from Massachusetts, for example, has been a more measured voice among Senate Democrats concerned with TikTok’s access to personal data and its effect on young Americans. When I asked his office about his thoughts on the platform’s future in the US, a spokesperson responded with an acknowledgment of the trade-offs the app poses: “They are the best of technologies, and they are the worst of technologies. They can enable and ennoble, or they can degrade and debase. But he still believes in their ability to enable and ennoble — for example bringing young people together online around the Green New Deal climate justice movement.”", "Markey also supports more stringent legislation to protect children’s and teens’ user data, like his Children and Teens’ Online Privacy and Protection Act to implement a computer code of conduct, ban targeted ads to children, raise the age of consent for collecting user data to under 17, and empower the Federal Trade Commission to monitor privacy concerns for youth.", "That’s a very different position from that of most Republican members of Congress, who support either a complete ban on the app operating in the US or a sale of the app to an American company.", "Jackson, the first-term North Carolina representative, fully accepts the validity of the national security concerns that his colleagues in the House and Senate have raised. “The security concerns are real. I’ve read what FBI Director [Christopher] Wray thinks about it, and I take his assessment seriously. I agree with not allowing TikTok on government phones,” Jackson told me, referencing Congress’s rules on installing or having the app on any government-issued device or public internet network.", "Apart from his personal and government-issued phones, he uses a third phone as a TikTok burner, with TikTok the only app installed on it. While he shoots and edits his own videos using Adobe Premiere, he doesn’t use the app at work.

That doesn’t mean he’s posting through every controversy of the day. As a candidate, his videos tended to be more like daily journal entries, highlighting interactions with voters at community events. Some of his posts even feel delightfully mundane: what it’s like to be a new member of Congress looking for an office, or a committee assignment, or, most recently, how his personal finances work.", "Jackson told me that the biggest subject his constituents and his TikTok audience tend to ask about is political corruption and stock trading by members of Congress. Allegations that prominent federal officials ", " privileged information to make financial decisions during the early days of the pandemic renewed calls in the past year to ban members of Congress from trading stocks.  ", "After seeing this demand in his comments, Jackson felt an obligation to film a TikTok walking his audience through his family’s finances. ", " showed me a lot of the still-untapped potential of political TikTok even as its future remains in doubt. Here we have a rather standard-issue member of Congress dryly listing out facts of his financial life — “I have a 2017 Ford Fusion, which I bought used,” Jackson says to the camera — not a revolutionary line of political communication or anything resembling social media fodder. But the video still went viral. It’s been watched over 1 million times in just under two weeks."]},

While the premise remains the same — two gay dads and their child are terrorized by four radical home invaders who claim an apocalypse is coming — Shyamalan’s movie takes a completely different turn, and changes not only the ending but also the themes, message, and moral questions posited in Tremblay’s novel. The result is a film that will appeal to fans of the emotional torture depicted in", ", with a very clear answer on whether this gay family saves the world.", " for the most part, sticks to the “rules” of the novel. The family — Andrew (Ben Aldridge), Eric (Jonathan Groff), and Wen (Kristen Cui) — are told that they must sacrifice and kill one of their own in order to stop the apocalypse from happening. That kill cannot be accidental or suicidal and must be a decision made with a clear mind. If they choose not to kill one of their own, one of the visitors — Leonard (Dave Bautista), Redmond (Rupert Grint), Sabrina (Nikki Amuka-Bird), and Adriane (Abby Quinn) — will be killed by the others and a plague will be unleashed upon the world. The visitors will ask the family for a decision as long as one of them is standing. When no more visitors are left, the apocalypse happens.", "These very specific death guidelines put the family in a morally impossible position of watching the world burn or killing someone they love. Because the family chooses not to kill anyone when first asked, tsunamis strike the US’s Pacific Coast. When they don’t give a second answer, a viral outbreak begins. The third plague has planes falling from the sky. Still, Eric and Andrew are skeptical, raising the possibility that the visitors have deluded themselves into believing this outrageous prophecy. (After all, horrible things do happen in our world ... kind of a lot.)", "Throughout both the cinematic adaptation and the source material, the family tries to escape and the visitors thwart them. In the novel, this comes to a head after the first visitor is sacrificed. Andrew escapes and scrambles to his car to retrieve his gun. He kills Adriane, one of the visitors. In an ensuing scuffle with Leonard, the gun goes off and his child Wen is killed. Her death is an accident, though, and it does not stop the apocalypse. ", "At the end of the novel, the heartbroken fathers refuse to kill each other, leaving whoever survives entirely alone. After the last visitor kills herself, they drive away with their daughter’s body, unsure of what’s next. ", "The movie begins to break away from the book after the first sacrifice, and the final sequence of events in the novel does not happen.", "In ", ", Andrew does get ahold of his gun. He shoots Sabrina, a different visitor than the one he kills in the novel (the order of the last two visitors’ deaths is also different in the movie). Andrew does scuffle with Leonard. At no point is Wen accidentally shot and killed.", "In the movie’s skirmish, Andrew loses control of the gun and Leonard grabs it. Leonard, armed, leads the family to the backyard and asks them a final time if they’ll sacrifice one of their own. The fathers send Wen to a treehouse and tell Leonard they will not kill each other. Leonard tells them that when he dies, they will only have minutes to stop the apocalypse. He kills himself, unleashing the final plague: lightning and fire from the sky.", "After Leonard’s death, Andrew and Eric hustle back into the cabin and talk about what they should do next. Andrew says this whole thing is absolutely absurd and that they would never kill each other. But Eric is more convinced by the catastrophes and thinks that he should die to save the world. They go back and forth, only stopping when Eric tells Andrew that Wen needs to have a future. He tells his husband that he sees a timeline in which Wen is grown and Andrew is old, where they both love each other immensely. The scene ends with a gunshot, and cuts to Andrew climbing up the treehouse alone to fetch Wen.", "With that drastic change, the endings between the two versions are obviously extremely different. The book sees Andrew and Eric, distraught after the loss of their daughter, pledging to stay together regardless of what happens. In that version, the apocalypse is more ambiguous, due in part to how empty and hopeless Andrew and Eric are after watching their daughter shot to death.", "The movie’s ending is much more concrete. Eric and Andrew fulfilled the rules, and therefore Eric’s death should stop the end of the world. And from all appearances, this is exactly what happens. ", "After the ordeal at the cabin, Andrew takes Wen to the visitors’ abandoned truck and drives to a local diner. There, they see a group of people taking shelter and watching the news. On the broadcast, it appears that the flooding from the first plague, the virus from the second, the airplanes falling from the sky from the third, and the lightning from the fourth plague have simply stopped, all around the world. The newscaster talks about survivors and the diner patrons talk about how all the bad stuff suddenly halted, signaling that the family’s sacrifice saved the world.", "That finale is more hopeful, as Eric and Andrew were able to take responsibility for all the bad stuff thrown at them by a vengeful God and save the world, I guess? But I’d argue there’s something just as heroic about not participating in that vengeful God’s game and, like Eric and Andrew in the book, pledging to be together even if it means the end. ", "The stakes, of course, are intensely altered when there’s a child still in the mix. Wen being alive turns the movie into a choice about Eric and Andrew’s parental responsibility for her and her future. Eric’s choice to sacrifice his life for his child is less complex (it’s a question we’ve seen ", ") than the book’s conundrum of having to choose to sacrifice himself after the loss of his daughter and thereby abandoning his husband to an uncertain, terminally depressing future. ", "The last shot of the movie has Andrew and Wen driving away into the sunset, crisis averted. They both know Eric is a hero and saved billions of people around the planet. Maybe Andrew and Wen will fulfill Eric’s vision of growing old and happy. After the trauma of their home being invaded, watching those home invaders kill themselves, surviving four plagues, and, in Andrew’s case, killing his husband, I hope they fulfill a vision of getting so, so much therapy.

It’s simply a mass reaction to a mass movement. Those who enact the backlash, Faludi writes, are often unaware “of their role; some even consider themselves feminists. For the most part, its workings are encoded and internalized, diffuse and chameleonic.” But she finds the pattern of this diffuse, unplanned backlash emerging throughout American history, every time the women’s movement appears to be making gains. ", " is generally dated to the Seneca Falls convention of 1848. In the half-century that followed, as women agitated for the vote, more than 100 states passed laws restricting divorce. In the late 19th century, for the first time in American history, it became a federal crime to distribute contraception, and most states had outlawed abortion. ", "Meanwhile, studies circulated warning that only 28 percent of college-educated women would ever be married. A bestselling book by a Harvard professor argued that a “brain-womb conflict” would lead educated women into an infertility epidemic. Career women were said to be succumbing to “hermaphroditism.” Teddy Roosevelt declared the white women who postponed childbirth to be “criminals against the race,” while the married women pushing for rights were creating a “crisis in the family.” ", "“If we trace these occurrences in American history,” Faludi writes in ", ", “we find such flare-ups are hardly random; they have always been triggered by the perception — accurate or not — that women are making great strides.”", "In 2017, women seemed to be making great strides. The backlash is here to correct for that. ", "Faludi argues that each feminist backlash always centers on two “pressure points,” which it rapidly endangers: a woman’s control over her own fertility, and a woman’s claim to her own paycheck. That’s the case here, too.", "The ", " decision was a wrecking ball aimed squarely at a woman’s control over her own fertility. Generations of women went to bed one night entitled to a constitutional right they were born with — a right to reproductive freedom — and woke up the next day without it. Almost immediately, story after story emerged of ", " ", " ", ", ", " ", "; of ", ", forced to cross state lines to get an abortion. ", "As for a woman’s claim to her own paycheck: It’s worth remembering that Me Too is, at its core, a workplace safety movement. The stories that launched Me Too into public consciousness were about people (mostly women) accusing their professional superiors (mostly men) of using their professional power to facilitate sexual harassment and assault. ", "In a time of backlash, Faludi writes, “the culture simply redoubles its resistance [to women in the workplace], if not by returning women to the kitchen, then by making the hours spent away from their stoves as inequitable and intolerable as possible.” One of the culture’s strategies, Faludi finds, is “subjecting them to harassment.”", "We’re currently in the midst of a spate of high-profile celebrity trials focusing on whether women should get to keep their money or whether they should be dependent on men who they have said behaved violently to them. Frequently, the results are not looking great for women.", "This year, we’ll see a lawsuit between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie proceed, with Pitt suing Jolie over her decision to sell her share of a vineyard they used to own together. Pitt says that Jolie sold her half of the property to a hostile company after promising never to sell it, but Jolie says she tried to sell her shares to Pitt directly and he refused — unless she was willing to sign an NDA swearing she would never discuss the ", " during which Pitt allegedly assaulted both Jolie and their children. Here, Pitt is seemingly attempting to tie up Jolie’s money with her silence in the face of his own alleged violence. ", " ", " ", " ", " overwhelmingly supporting Pitt’s side of the story, painting Jolie as a wronged woman out for revenge.", "In June, ", " after she accused him of domestic violence. This case might not seem to fit into the pattern of the backlash separating women from their paychecks, since Depp and Heard were married, but it’s important to remember that they were also co-workers. They met when Depp cast Heard to play his love interest in ", " in 2009. Their romance began on the set where they worked together. After their divorce, ", ". Heard did not experience the beginning of her relationship with Depp as an abuse of his power, but after she left the violence of their relationship, Depp used his professional power to target her ability to earn her living.", "The examples have continued to mount: Danny Masterson was accused of rape by four women, one of them a former co-worker. ", ". Kevin Spacey was found not liable for battery ", " brought against him by Anthony Rapp, who says Spacey molested him when Rapp was 14 and Spacey 26, after they had appeared in Broadway shows together. Megan Thee Stallion was shot by a fellow rapper after she made it clear she outranked him professionally. She found herself ", " over the course of his December trial.", "One of the oddities of our current moment is how frequently the backlash avails itself of the rhetoric the Me Too movement developed. That slippage, too, is characteristic of backlash, which Faludi used as the title of her book in reference to a 1947 film of the same name, in which a man frames his wife for the murder he committed. “The backlash against women’s rights works in much the same way,” Faludi writes: “its rhetoric charges feminists with all the crimes it perpetrates.”", "Me Too and its sister ", " campaigns were built around a rhetoric of justice: At last, powerful men would stop being able to get away with it, would be made to face meaningful consequences for what they had done. The backlash flips the script: At last, all these powerful people (women en masse) will stop being able to get away with it (preying on men).", "The #TimesUp hashtag was created to push for systemic change in Hollywood and other industries, to call for the professional empowerment and advancement of women so that the Harvey Weinsteins of the world wouldn’t be able to abuse their own power so easily. But now, it’s become a way to call out any woman who is currently unpopular, painting the callout with a veneer of activist virtue, in what Faludi calls “a coup through euphemism.” ", "Now, when a famous woman is in the cultural crosshairs, she is charged with having committed some nebulous abuse of power. At various points over the past few months, social media has trended with #TimesUpOlivia (because Olivia Wilde was in a consensual relationship with Harry Styles, who was 10 years younger than her and an actor in the film she directed), #TimesUpAmber (because a tenet of faith for Depp partisans is that Amber Heard was the true abuser in their relationship), and #TimesUpMeghan (because Meghan Markle has been accused of bullying her staff).", "This rhetorical reversal can also happen in more subtle ways. Last November, Ben Smith — media critic, former editor-in-chief of BuzzFeed News, and founder of the media company Semafor — ", ", the novelist who was accused of sexual misconduct in 2018. In his article, Smith favors Díaz’s story while giving the impression that he is correcting an unethical bias in previous reporting. Smith suggests throughout the piece that the accusations against Díaz have been blown out of proportion, and that Díaz did not deserve to lose his professional standing so dramatically: that Díaz has, in other words, faced a miscarriage of justice. “It’s like being in prison for a crime you didn’t commit,” Smith quotes one of Díaz’s friends as saying. ", "Smith’s article is exemplary of backlash because of how thoroughly and invisibly it returns to a pre-Me Too understanding of how we should treat accusations of sexual misconduct. ", ", Smith downplays and belittles the accusations against Díaz. He reveals with a flourish that when Díaz was accused of a “forcible kiss,” the kiss in question was only on the cheek — as though a kiss on the cheek cannot constitute sexual harassment. He treats the stories of Díaz’s accusers with extreme skepticism and the stories of Díaz and his allies with extreme credulousness. He does not engage with or outright ignores many of the public accusations against Díaz. Multiple people who spoke out against Díaz in 2018 say ", ".", "One of the distinctive patterns of backlash is its strategy of making false concessions. Its rhetoric will generally admit that there was at one point a problem; that at some point in the bad old days, women really did have to worry about inequality. Then the backlash posits that the problem has been solved well before it actually has been. “The anti-feminist backlash has been set off not by women’s achievement of full equality but by the increased possibility that they might win it,” says Faludi. “It is a preemptive strike that stops women long before they reach the finish line.”", "“The reckoning brought on by the #MeToo movement, reported on by my Pulitzer Prize-winning colleagues at The Times, was long overdue and a huge net positive,” ", ". “It took years of dogged reporting on odious cases like those of Bill O’Reilly, Matt Lauer and Harvey Weinstein to fuel the #MeToo movement, bringing necessary attention to the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace. The behavior here was clearly egregious; the results were clear-cut and necessary.”", ", Paul went on: Surely Me Too had by now gone far enough? Surely it had targeted too many innocent men? “We’ve thought a lot, as a country, about what to do with the men who are guilty of sexual violence and harassment,” Paul concluded. “We’ve thought about how seriously to take such accusations and what to do with the monsters. But we still haven’t thought enough about how to handle all accusations with proportion and fairness.”", "After all, she pointed out, not every accused predator is Harvey Weinstein.", "In December, ", ". He is now awaiting sentencing for that conviction, on top of the 23-year sentence he is currently serving after being convicted in New York state on multiple counts of rape and sexual assault. ", "Weinstein’s multiple convictions have served as a milestone of sorts for the Me Too movement: the ogre whose crimes sent the whole movement screaming into the public eye, the boogeyman next to whom everyone else’s monstrousness looks small and petty — at last, he has been brought to justice. ", "Weinstein is 70 years old. It is extremely likely that he will die in jail. In a culture that only speaks carceral languages when it comes to responding to crimes, surely this is what justice looks like. ", "The question I keep asking myself during this time of backlash is: Are Weinstein’s convictions a victory, or are they a scapegoating? ", "I can’t shake the sense that these convictions are a way of targeting all the movement’s anger onto one man, rather than onto the systems that let him operate with impunity, or the other men who took advantage of those systems in perhaps slightly less grotesque ways than did Weinstein. Rather than doing the difficult work of redistributing power and thinking about what a meaningful response to various forms of sexual misconduct should look like, we can simply point to Weinstein’s fate and say, “See? We fixed it. And anyway, this predator isn’t as bad as Weinstein, so what does it matter?”", "Weinstein also serves as an avatar for the figure whom Me Too seems to have been, in a way, intended to punish: Donald Trump. Trump was elected despite being caught on tape apparently bragging about assaulting women, and despite ", ". It is no accident that Me Too hit its peak of public outrage in the year that Trump took office; it is also no accident that public interest in the movement cooled dramatically as soon as he was out of office. Me Too was the punishment of Trump by proxy, with Weinstein playing the role of the comically villainous and far-too-powerful predator mogul. ", "Currently, Trump is facing a lawsuit from writer E. Jean Carroll for ", " and ", ". If Carroll wins and Trump is found liable, how much will this be a victory for the movement? And how much will it be a public sacrifice for a movement the public has already dropped?", "If we want real and lasting change, we have to do more than target two individual monsters and then go back to ignoring all our other problems. I don’t want to have to wait another 30 years before we get to make progress again. What will it take to break the backlash pattern once and for all? "]},

Not your typical Oscar fare.", "It has netted a whopping 11 Oscar nominations, and two of its stars — Ke Huy Quan and Michelle Yeoh — have been feted all awards season. Could this little film that became a sensation have a chance on Hollywood’s big night?", "To discuss why the film was such a success, why it tugged at audiences’ heartstrings, and what it would mean if it won Best Picture, we gathered Vox culture reporters Alissa Wilkinson, Alex Abad-Santos, and Aja Romano, along with politics reporter Li Zhou, for a discussion around a (virtual) roundtable.", " ", " (EEAAO) turned out to be a bona fide sensation, and I confess I was a little surprised. Maybe I’m just brain-poisoned from years of seeing only franchise films top the charts, but I thought this kooky, frenetic, big-hearted, wild-imagination film might be too much for audiences. Yet it really turned out to be the little movie that could. It opened modestly and never really ", ", but it played in ", " (which most movies don’t get to do these days) and ended up making a very healthy amount of money: over $70 million in the US, and over $100 million worldwide, the magic number that turns a movie from a “modest success” to a hit. All that with a modest budget of around $25 million, and without a Marvel star or preexisting IP in sight. And those numbers tell a story — in this case, that the main ingredient in its success was word-of-mouth buzz.", "People who saw it liked it, and they grabbed their friends by the shoulders and yelled, “You too must see this!” and went back a second and maybe a third time to see it again. That’s the way movies used to be, but few get that chance anymore. So I want to ask: In your estimation, what accounts for that success? What about it grabbed people enough that they had to grab their friends? What’s the secret sauce? Why did you see it?", " Throughout EEAAO’s theatrical run, one of the big explanations of why it was doing so well was ", " — basically that people who saw the movie went and told everyone how great it was. The funny thing about that is that this movie is impossible to explain. No amount of description — alternate timelines, jumps, existential crises, moms, hot dog fingers, butt plugs, etc. — could ever accurately describe what’s happening at any given moment during this maximalist fantasia. And if you tried to describe all those things, I don’t think that would sell the movie.", "I think what I ended up doing was that I would tell someone, “Go see this movie.” Then that person sees it, and you can finally talk to them about how absolutely bonkers everything is. You can say, “THE ROCKS!” and the other person will say, “THE ROCKS!” and then you both say, “THE ROCKS!” and it’s like speaking a secret language, which I think all points to how the Daniels, Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, and that incredible cast pulled it off.", "When we think about the ", ", I think there are a couple of factors. One is the sheer popular appeal of a movie produced by the guys behind ", ", made by the guys who did the", ", with a cast that includes a martial arts movie legend, a horror scream queen, and an ‘80s action movie child star. It’s a storyline about a multiverse with an entire subplot dedicated to homaging ", ".

We live in an era where our foremost Black rapper is a ", ", where ", " for teaching kids about their feelings, where chatbots are ", " gigantic-chested fake girls with missing fingers and extra eyelids. Reality seems more overwhelmingly surreal by the day, so why not make a movie that combats existential despair using positive absurdism, where Jamie Lee Curtis may have hot dogs for hands. Even people with hot dogs for hands can have epic multiverse-spanning love stories, and that’s beautiful.", "Because the other thing about this movie is not just that it got incredible word-of-mouth, but that everyone also told you to bring tissues: that this was not just a fun, zany, chaotic brain-buster of a movie, but one that would shred your heart in the best way.", "Yes! It’s that combination of tenderness and spectacle that ultimately got me. The quiet moments that the film sets up between its main characters including Evelyn (Michelle Yeoh) and Waymond (Ke Huy Quan) amid the literal chaos that everyone has alluded to, are such an artful contrast and respite. ", "The now-iconic line about laundry and taxes, for example, is so emblematic of how the movie is part pandemonium and part raw emotion. In the end, EEAAO has got cooking raccoons, martial arts battles, and BDSM interludes, as well as this mushy and warmhearted core that’s captivating in its own right.", " Among the movie’s many virtues — and we all agree, it has many — is the way it deals with some potentially thorny or tricky subjects in the form of a multi-universe melodrama/comedy. It’s about ", ", about ", ", about regretting your past, about depression and anxiety, and about the experience of a family in which the parents are Asian immigrants and the daughter was raised in America.

Like, yes, a scene about how difficult it is for immigrant parents to fully understand their kids’ lives (and vice versa) is going to strike a nerve! At the same time, Yeoh’s Evelyn and Hsu’s Joy felt like distinct characters with unique journeys that I wanted to see more of and was refreshed by.", "I do find it wickedly funny that a few years ago, the buzz was about ", " and what its success meant for Asian American representation in Hollywood movies. At the time, I tepidly ", " that hopefully we would get to the point where Asian people didn’t have to be rich or glamorous to warrant a movie being made about them, that maybe true equality and representation would mean that “crazy poor Asians” would get to have stories too. And, well, ", ", and three years later we have a story about a depressed Asian American immigrant mom and her existentially crisis-afflicted daughter in the running for another top award.", " A lot has been written about Joy’s monster as a metaphor for her depression, and I think the movie handled that so well, but it was Evelyn’s anxiety that also really spoke to me, personally — she had this sense of feeling overwhelmed with every small thing she had to do just to get through daily living. With Joy, my feeling was closer to, “Is she depressed or just living in 2022?” ", "But also the dynamic between them was so rich and painfully real — the barbs they exchanged landed every time. Certainly every queer kid can relate to the horror of one’s parents trying to mitigate the way they introduce their significant other to relatives who might be less than charitable. The deep hurt and tension laced throughout those scenes was a stellar example of how this movie shows you its taut intergenerational conflicts without spelling them out. Such disparate 2022 movies as ", " and the horror film ", " also prominently featured Asian diaspora protagonists working through a lot of trauma as immigrants and reconciling with their parents across generational and cultural conflicts. As with both of those films, I found this one extremely universally relatable on all these fronts.", " To Alex’s point, the fact that this film, and multiple others that have garnered acclaim in recent years, like ", ", are about the stories of different Asian American families without relying on dated tropes or the qualifier of being “crazy rich” is pretty moving and feels significant.

As a child of immigrants, I’ve definitely witnessed the fracturing between different generations of family members that can be part of the immigrant experience, and the film does a really admirable job capturing the enduring nature of that pain. Relatedly, I thought James Hong’s performance — in addition to those of the other leads — was phenomenal and should be getting more hype.", "There’s one other big part of this movie that seems hot right now: Like many a recent blockbuster (we are looking at you, MCU), it’s about the multiverse. More specifically, it uses the idea of many universes coexisting to plumb something that feels very true about love, relationships, regret, and empathy.", "It’s interesting to me to see multiverse concepts employed in this manner — it’s a little like what actually does happen in the MCU, but instead of being focused on the action, it’s focused on the emotion. Why do you think this concept resonates so much with filmmakers and audiences right now?", "I think it goes back to that feeling of being overwhelmed that I spoke of earlier. Reality is just ", " lately, and it’s partly in response to that feeling that we’ve seen an increase in a kind of performative nihilism — everything from edgelord meme culture to shitposting to ", " and ", ". We see that reflected in the film: Joy’s — er, Jobu Tupaki’s reason for trying to destroy the multiverse is that “nothing matters.”", "And when you’re faced with that kind of argument, the only possible answer a hopeful human being can really provide, if we want to not be crushed beneath the weight of the alternate possibility, is: “No, everything matters.”", "What better way to show that than through a multiverse where everything, every act and choice, even tiny gestures of humanity or inhumanity, has a ripple effect — not just across lives but across dimensions? Everything, everywhere, all at once, matters.", "I have to agree with Aja. One of the more popular refrains of the last few years is that we are all living in the stupidest timeline. And we do! There are so many heinously daft things happening in all of our lives right now that sometimes you cannot help but laugh at it all! The hope and possibility that there’s a version of me living a better, more fun, more hilarious life than me right now is such a joy to think about, and I think that — in large part — is what makes the movie feel so nourishing.", " One of the other functions of the multiverse that felt particularly special in", " is how this concept enabled the actors to take on different versions of their characters. The toggling back and forth between the various Waymonds, Evelyns, Joys, and Gong Gongs was both impressive to witness and an approach that was constantly pushing the audience to reconsider its perception of various characters. ", "The contrast between Alpha Waymond and Regular Waymond, for instance, offered this really interesting commentary on masculinity, and how the value of kindness, playfulness, and optimism, is often overlooked.", "So now I guess it’s time to address the googly-eyed rock in the room: Can this movie win Best Picture? I vacillate wildly between thinking it’s a slam-dunk and a long shot. Maybe it’s both. And if you don’t care to venture a guess at the mind of the Academy, what would it mean for a movie like this to win at the Oscars?", " I have a tip that gives me peace of mind, and it is that awards don’t matter. These awards don’t reward quality or ingenuity or feats! They’re mostly popularity contests and the result of who ", "! And I usually stick to that worldview unless, of course, something (the 2009 movie ", ") or someone (Rihanna, Beyoncé, Carly Rae Jepsen) I deeply admire wins, because then, of course, awards do matter and the correct person or movie or album won!", "In this case, I think EEAAO has enough things that the Academy likes — a story about America, an under-appreciated star lead in Michelle Yeoh, a great Jamie Lee Curtis performance, etc. — that it can win. I feel like the real story is Yeoh’s shot at Best Actress, as it will be the Academy’s chance to play a part in a feel-good story about feeling seen and people finally recognizing Yeoh’s talent. But again, we don’t need the Oscars to tell us that Yeoh always brings a dignity and sparkling thrill to every character she plays.", "I do think Ke Huy Quan is almost certainly a lock for Supporting Actor, and it seems like his comeback story is destined to be one of the more storied Hollywood glow-ups. If Michelle Yeoh wins, it will be a welcome sign of the Academy’s ongoing shift toward a broader appreciation of a diversity of experience and range of talent; it would be a huge feat to pull off a win over Cate Blanchett in the year of ", ", but if anyone can do it, it’s Yeoh.", "There is something kind of delightful to think about how this incredibly imaginative — and at times truly wild — film could win in an awards show that’s been known for being pretty stuffy in the past. ", "I’m also keeping a close eye on the long-overdue acting awards, while echoing the caveat that Yeoh and Quan don’t need any such recognition to validate their incredible performances. My secret hope is that the actors would perhaps go even further in calling Hollywood out if they win, though fully admire just how gracious they were at the Globes and beyond. ", "I couldn’t agree more. I’ve been lucky enough to hear Quan give several speeches (including at the awards gala for my own critics’ group awards!) and he fits the comeback narrative perfectly — and on top of it, it would be a delight to see him win. But mostly, I’d take an ", " win as a sign that something — taste, proclivities, signs of what’s “best” — has shifted in the Academy along with the ", ".", "Whatever the case, though, when I get down about the state of Hollywood (and I do, pretty often), I look at movies like this one as a sign of hope. Even if it wasn’t your favorite film of the year — and it wasn’t for me! — it’s a warm-hearted burst of creativity that’s not quite like anything the business usually churns out, and I’m so glad to see it make it into awards conversations.

And not just any year. Just before lockdowns in early 2020, Benito released ", " (A Spanish acronym for “I do whatever I want”). It’s a garage-y, nostalgic ode to early reggaetón and hip hop with powerhouse features from Daddy Yankee, Anuel AA, Arcángel, and more.

It’s also the simplicity of his music. His music is very elaborate in terms of production, his performance is very simple — that’s why people connect with it so much.” ", "Everyone loves a summer album, and 2022’s ", "proves it on an international scale. Right as travel became a more viable option globally in early May, Bad Bunny drops ", " with immersive 360-degree visualizers on YouTube.

If you couldn’t gel with Bad Bunny before, it’d be hard to find something you couldn’t vibe with on the 23-track album. It bridged the generational gap that eluded him before. “You know, I was a bit resistant to Bad Bunny — I’m an old Latino man,” said Chirinos. “At the very beginning, I was like, ‘I don’t know. I don’t get this guy.’ I didn’t know why people were so crazy about him until I listened to ", ". It became my number one album last year by far. There are some songs that I think are some of the best songs not just on the album, but ever.”", "The album, easily, is a love letter to the music of the Caribbean. It pulls from bachata, bomba, merengue, dembow, reggae, cumbia, and bossa nova with electricity. It features reggaetón greats like Tony Dize and Plan B’s Chencho Corleone while also advancing the next generation of Latinx music makers, like The Marías, Buscabulla, and Bomba Estereo. (Bad Bunny probably could have put more effort in featuring Afro-Latinos, given how heavy their influence is here.) The breadth of genre and interplay in ", "was sonically familiar globally — after all, who hasn’t felt the irresistible tug of bachata drums, begging you to dance?", "“You can hear the Dominican Republic, the Lesser Antilles, and of course, Puerto Rico,” Meléndez-Badillo said. “Although he is paying a tribute or an homage to the Caribbean, particularly summers in the Caribbean, it’s a record that did not have a particular listening audience. That is why it made it such a huge deal when it came out.” ", "It’s a funny paradox: ", " is simultaneously Bad Bunny’s most global album and his most Puerto Rican. While the music clearly brings in influences from elsewhere that can attract listeners from around the globe, lyrically Bad Bunny is singing to the specifics of the Puerto Rican experience. In “", ",” he sings alongside Buscabulla’s Raquel Berríos about a woman who wants to live her life free from societal pressure. The album’s star song, though, is “", ",” a lively EDM track where Benito champions the beauty of Puerto Rico and ", " and ", " happening on the island. “I don’t want to leave / let them go,” sings Gabriela Berlingeri (Benito’s partner) in Spanish. “This is my beach / this is my sun / this my land / this is me.” ", "Authenticity like that can’t be manufactured.

It’s this really beautiful example of the fact that you can create for a particular people, you can create for your nation, you can create with this particular kind of purpose. You can deal with it or not. And everyone is dealing with it and loving it.”", "Bad Bunny does not need the American Grammys. For all intents and purposes, he is already at the top of the charts, has a burgeoning ", ", and moonlights as ", " when he finds the time.

You might be thinking: Okay, who cares, the Latin Pop and Latin Urban categories are there, too. But language shouldn’t be siloed, when you can sing any song in any language. If Shakira sang “Hips Don’t Lie” in Spanish, she wouldn’t have been nominated for ", " in the 00s. It’s historic that Bad Bunny’s album has the honor of going up against Beyoncé. ", "The nomination also signals a readiness and openness for American audiences to embrace non-English music. We’re already seeing this happen with ", " and the proliferation of K-pop with BTS (although K-pop stars do tend to incorporate English). Bad Bunny sticking with Spanish is exciting, and indicative of a cultural shift. “We might start seeing other folks who are artists who don’t speak or don’t want to speak English in their music getting huge at this global level,” Díaz said. “He’s setting a completely new precedent that actually is going to change the trajectory of global music.” ", "According to data from ", ", consumption of Latin music grew by 28 percent in 2022, and Bad Bunny’s responsible for the top four albums in the genre. That’s only expected to grow as Latinx populations grow in the next few decades, says Chirinos. Latin genres are spreading far and wide, with streaming only increasing the possibilities in genre fusion and exploration.", "“Reggaetón is becoming, in a way, a dominant pop music format, or a format that many international artists would probably choose to use because it appeals to international audiences,” Chirinos said. “Streaming is opening the doors that were perhaps closed before in Latin America. Right now, one of the largest markets for streaming music consumption is Mexico. Another one is Brazil. And these are markets poised to grow. It’s an appealing idea for the music industry, looking at Latin America as well as Africa, as the emerging markets for music consumption. That’s where young people are being born.” ", "Latin music or culture can’t be ignored in a world where Bad Bunny is a superstar, which is true regardless of how the Grammys shake out. He’s an artist who’s helping to explode the reach of his genres, while simultaneously exploding what the genres have to offer. That kind of expansion, it can’t be denied.", "“We can’t take that for granted or underestimate the long-term cultural value of the moment,” Díaz said. “All of these things create this really important cultural opening. On a Puerto Rican level, on an American level, on a global level.” "]},

Unlike the MLB and NBA, where wealthy “glamour” teams can dominate because of their spending advantages or their locales, pro football distributes its revenue evenly among its 32 teams and strictly controls their payrolls, giving each a fairer shot at attracting and keeping talent.

Shah will have to surrender herself to prison on February 17, 2023, and will be subject to five years of supervised release after serving her sentence.", "Before she admitted to being a wire fraudster, Shah had made a name for herself on Bravo’s ", ". She rose to fame by flaunting her money on television and starting fights with her fellow cast members, in particular by calling ex-Housewife Mary Cosby a “grandpa fucker” (Cosby ", " and has a child by him). In their season-long spat, Cosby said that Shah smelled like a hospital. And with that, Bravo had a delirious first season hit on its hands. ", "But the charges Shah faces aren’t as frivolous as the petty fights on a Bravo television show. Authorities say, and Shah admitted, that she used telemarketing to target and defraud unwitting strangers, many of whom were older and living off their savings. ", "During the sentencing, Assistant US Attorney Robert Sobelman spoke about how Shah showed no remorse about defrauding her victims, ", " in which Shah reportedly mocked an 80-year-old victim to her fellow defendants. Sobelman stated that there were “thousands” of victims just like the ones she mocked. ", "Shah and her attorney Priya Chaudhry spoke about Shah’s remorse, saying that she’s had a change of heart. Hearing the victims’ accounts, Chaudhry said, made Shah realize the massive amount of fraud and damage she had done. Shah said that her television persona, including her “Shah-mazing” tagline, were all Bravo’s doing. Shah also seemed to imply that the judge should be more lenient to her scheme because she is an immigrant. ", "“I stand before you as an immigrant from Tonga and Hawaii,” ", " (Hawaii is a US state), stating that she violated Hawaiian and Tongan culture by committing crimes against elderly people. “The principles are humility and loyalty and respect. I have come to terms I have gone against these. I am sorry. My actions have hurt innocent people.”", "Jen Shah isn’t the first criminal to be sentenced, nor will she be the last.

But while others have been rung up on charges from DUIs and assault to tax and bankruptcy fraud, Shah stands out for running a criminal conspiracy with unwitting elderly victims. And she did it, supposedly, before and during Bravo’s filming.", "Shah’s legal case has been going on for over a year. Back in March 2021, Shah was arrested (during filming, and more on this in a bit) along with Stuart Smith, whom the show described as her “assistant.” The pair were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. According to the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, this was “in connection with telemarketing and conspiracy to commit money laundering.”", "The term wire fraud refers to the act of using a phone or the internet to commit financial fraud. When it comes to Shah, the", " explained that she sold lists of individuals, usually older adults, to other members of her “scheme” so that they could defraud them. Through telemarketing, Shah and her cohort would promise these individuals business opportunities, but after the victims handed over their cash, those opportunities never materialized. ", "The US Attorney’s Office added that it was an intricate and expansive web that crossed state lines: Leads were initially generated by sales floors operating in Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, among other places. The owners and operators of those sales floors operated in coordination with several telemarketing sales floors in the New York and New Jersey area, including in Manhattan, and provided lead lists and assistance in fighting victim refund requests to other participants operating those floors.", "Shah pleaded not guilty a month later, in April 2021.

", "When it comes to any candid reality show — and especially the ", " franchises —", "audiences aren’t really getting reality. ", ", which are up for renewal each season. If a cast member fails to add to the drama or spectacle of the show, they’re not asked back. That creates an incentive for Housewives to perform for the cameras and really lean into the drama of a season, even though that might not necessarily be “real” behavior.", "Housewives have also formed a symbiotic relationship with the franchise in the sense that they use their respective shows to launch new businesses or promote existing ones. Perhaps the biggest example is Bethenny Frankel’s low-cal margarita brand Skinnygirl, which Forbes reported that she sold to ", ". If someone’s selling a business, it’s in their best interest to project an image that doesn’t tarnish the brand — and again, that isn’t really “real” behavior.", "Suffice to say, it’s hard or maybe even detrimental for Housewives to be their “realest” selves on camera. In Jen Shah’s case, her tenure on ", " began much like any other cast member — a ravenous hunger for the spotlight, constant flaunting of wealth (with no real explanation of how it was attained), an attempt to launch a brand (Shah spent a lot of the first season touting her “Shah Squad” team and ", "), and a clear desire to secure a second season. But her time on the show slowly morphed into a weird, often bleak, look at the legal fight to keep her out of jail.", "The show soured for Shah in her second season when her March arrest was caught on tape. ", " episodes do not air in real time, so the news came first. Anyone, whether or not they were familiar with Shah or a fan of the ", " could find ", " detailing what she was accused of, how she was arrested, and the case that ", " had against her.", "The second season of ", " then premiered in September 2021, roughly six months after Shah’s arrest. Bravo promoted Shah’s arrest as a major plot point, and teased out footage of the law enforcement officials trying to corner Shah right before she took a cast trip to Vail, Colorado. As her cast members had their ", " (fellow housewife Lisa Barlow called multiple lawyers) to the arrest preserved in Bravo amber, Shah leaned into her arrest. Her tagline for that season: “The only thing I’m guilty of is being Shah-mazing!” ", "The cycle of something happening in Shah’s case — lawyers dropping out, the trial being postponed, new developments in the case — appearing in the news and the wait to see that play out months later onscreen became intrinsic to the show. As with Real Housewife of Beverly Hills ", " — whose lawyer husband Tom was accused of stealing from clients — it’s almost as if Bravo was producing a true crime documentary.", "I’m not a lawyer, but I can’t imagine that any attorney would want their client, especially one accused of committing a federal crime, filmed by a camera crew and edited by a team that said client has no control over. That just seems like it would open a very large door for self-incrimination. Yet here Shah was, living her post-arrest and pre-trial life on camera. To what benefit, it’s unclear.", "Throughout that second season, though, there are segments where Shah does meet with lawyers to discuss her case and affirm her innocence. The legal advice she seems to have been given, as evidenced by how she approached her case on the show, was to keep reiterating, on camera, that she was innocent and reminding us that in the American justice system, people are innocent until proven guilty. Shah also seems to shift into a less abrasive and less flamboyant personality as the season goes on, perhaps in an attempt to appear more sympathetic. In an especially desolate episode, the 15th of the season, ", " her daughter that she liquidated her 401(k) to help her pay for legal fees. (My sympathy here lies more with Charlene.)", "That season ends with the three-part reunion in which Shah proclaims her innocence again, saying that she’ll fight to the very end. It aired in March 2022, around five months before Shah changed her plea. Shah’s plea change occurred during filming for the third season, which premiered on September 28, 2022. Shah’s guilty plea, in fact, functions as the season finale.", "But Shah’s preempted plea reflexively informs, even undercuts, everything we see from her this season. She talks often about how hard the trial is, how hard it is to fight against a system that she says is stacked against her. She also says she’s worried about the example she’s setting for her kids. ", "Knowing that she pleaded guilty, these scenes feel even more hollow than usual Housewife shilling can be. Instead of diet-friendly alcohol, Shah is selling her own innocence. As the season goes on, it becomes increasingly difficult to imagine that this woman actually believes anything she says on camera. And it becomes a particularly heady game with producers: It seems like the editors’ intent is to show how much Shah was willing to put herself on camera in an effort to save her case. Now that time is over; Shah said she declined an invitation to the season’s reunion episodes (which filmed before her sentencing on Friday),", " that Bravo wanted her to discuss her case and that she could not fulfill that.", "The question for Bravo is what will become of the show now that Shah likely won’t return. So much of the franchise has been built around this wigged, explosive, over-the-top glamour queen, and the bulk of the last two seasons parlayed her trial into its marketing strategy. Will the franchise be able to survive as a show that isn’t about the Jen Shah trial? And is that something that fans will even want to watch?", "But it also feels a little icky in that the show provides Shah and her co-stars, on camera, a platform to speak profusely about Shah being wrongfully accused — but never really paints a clear or complete picture of the victims Shah now admits to defrauding. In court documents obtained by ", ", victims wrote about how Shah and her cohort had — through multiple rounds of telemarketing schemes promising business services — swindled them out of their savings and left them with mountains of debt and damaged relationships. ", "“I almost lost everything that I worked for, as well as my life and almost cost me my marriage as well as ruining my kids’ lives for eternity. What I thought started out to be an investment in a company that I could pass on to my children if the business got off the ground successfully, ended up almost ruining ALL OF OUR LIVES,” one of the victims wrote to the presiding judge, asking for appropriate punishment for Shah. ", "Undergirding the ", "franchises has always been the joy and stink of unearned wealth — first from the portrayal of cast members as dilettantes who had married into money and then, as the show became more and more of a launching pad for businesses, with often silly and self-serving attempts at entrepreneurship (from skin care lines to ", " to music careers) mixed in with the more legitimate products. While some of these Housewife careers may have been hollow or, practically speaking, worthless, they only had the air of a scam. But as more and more crimes have piled up, and now with the criminal charges ", " and accusations of ", " against ", ", it seemed almost inevitable that the day would arrive when the money we loved to watch would come, in clearly criminal and unwilling form, from us."]},

And so unfortunately, through my line of research, I have to spend time on the less enjoyable, less pleasant parts of the internet. So I spend time on manosphere subreddits, manosphere blogs, forums, and so on, trying to understand how masculinity gets configured and understood in these places. I think it was in one of those forays that Tate originally popped up, and it would probably have just been something that was linked to a Jordan Peterson video or a Ben Shapiro video or a Steven Crowder video. This is what’s occasionally called the “intellectual dark web.” YouTube’s algorithms put it through to my front page.

If you go on any YouTube video of him at all and you read the comments under the video, they’re almost all universally positive, praising Tate for how insightful, how brave, how inspirational he is. There’s very few dissenting voices on those YouTube comments.", "As you listened to Andrew Tate, talk to me about where your mind went on the question of: This man appeals to millions of people — why?", "I think that he is so seductive to such a big audience because the image of masculinity that he sells is one that’s very rooted in traditional male characteristics. He’s very big on this idea of the alpha male, the man that’s in control, that always knows what he’s doing, that always gets what he wants, that has everyone waiting [on] them hand and foot, and this idea that he’s infallible. I think some men can see that as a particularly attractive trait, but he’s also big on conspicuous consumption. He lives a very jet-set lifestyle: fast cars, private planes, mansions, expensive holidays away. ", "And then he has really traditional and, to my mind, outdated views about what a relationship should look like, and what the role of men and women in those relationships should be: The man is not just the protector but the patriarch, the provider. What he says goes, it’s his way or the highway; women are only there to attend to the house, to look after the kids, to really be in service of the relationship. I think my immediate reaction was probably one of sadness that this is the image of masculinity that sells.

It’s based on the idea that over the course of the last 20 to 30 years, the world has changed in a way that has decentered primarily young, white men, and they’ve moved from the center of society to the ", ". ", "Someone like Tate is attractive because he recenters young white men in a really obvious and very explicit way and basically says, “You’re important, you’re needed, your masculinity is needed to fight against all of the changes that are happening in the world. The world is no longer for you or wants to invest in you.” No longer are women reliant on men financially or emotionally. Someone like Tate basically says we will fight against that, by reclaiming this sense of primal, traditional masculinity. And that’s a story that goes all the way back to even the 1980s. ", "A lot of what Tate is saying in some sense isn’t actually new. It’s a rearticulation of a crisis of masculinity discourse that we see back in the 1970s, back in the 1980s, through the ", " led by people like Robert Bly and so on, where there was a sense of reconnecting with your own masculinity as a way of fixing the world. He’s only another entry in a long line of other men who have done something similar.", "Does your research show us anything about whether these young men who are impressed or seduced by Andrew Tate are fundamentally hateful people? Are they fundamentally misogynist, or are they unmoored young men who are being taken for a ride by a misogynist con artist?", "Someone like Tate tries to normalize misogyny. He makes it seem socially acceptable. He wraps it up in a discourse of rationality: “This is just the way that the world is. This is just the way that people are.” I don’t think we can say that the men that engage with this content are fundamentally misogynistic. It might be that through a process of repeated engagement with his content, of posting on forums about him or on Twitter or on YouTube comments or whatever, that they may be nudged toward these positions. But that’s what a lot of radicalization looks like: taking someone from one position and gradually moving them along that path of radicalization, where viewpoints which initially seemed extreme become normalized. ", "So the question then becomes, if not Andrew Tate, then what? We want to do better than this man. Where should young men be able to go if they want optimism and strength and attention to men’s issues, if we can call them that, but without the misogyny, without the hatred of women? ", "So first and foremost, I would say that young men shouldn’t be looking at social media personalities for what it is to be a man. They’re much better off looking within their local communities, their families, and their friendship networks to emulate masculinities that they find supportive, nurturing, and healthy. Places like community groups are really important spaces for young men to meet other men that they can look up to and that they can be mentored by. For those young men who are really struggling with their own sense of masculinity and what it is to be a man, things like counseling can be really helpful, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with seeking those kinds of forms of support out.", "As far as the manosphere goes, I have hopes — not high hopes but some hopes — of what a more progressive manosphere may look like, one that’s free of the misogyny and the anti-feminist stances that we see in a lot of manosphere spaces. Whether that will actually come to pass is an open question. But Tate sells this really romanticized, and to me quite superficial, idea of what it is to be a man. I know loads of men. I don’t know anybody who acts or talks or behaves like Andrew Tate. Tate is a Hollywood form of masculinity, but it’s one that is as deep as a puddle. There’s no substance. The men that I look up to — people like my dad, teachers I had in school, instructors I had when I was in my youth groups — those are the men that have given me the biggest lessons of my life. Those are the men that I will continue to look up to and learn from. And there’s men out there like that that other young men can aspire to be like and look up to and learn from and be guided by. But I don’t think Andrew Tate is the one that we should be putting up on a pedestal."]},

M3gan knows more about the world than the adults who created her want her to, and that’s a profoundly scary thing.", "When toy designer Gemma (Allison Williams) creates M3gan, it’s satisfying because she’s awful at being a parent to her orphan niece Cady. In the run of the movie, the meals Gemma prepares for Cady are: a piece of plain toast, a hot dog, and a slice of pizza with a vegetable topping, all signaling that Gemma does not know how to nourish a child. Further, Gemma doesn’t quite understand how to play with Cady; Gemma wants her to learn how to operate things like levers and switches, while Cady finds happiness in rolling objects like balls. Gemma also doesn’t comprehend how to put Cady through school or teach Cady educational lessons at home.

Gemma is as good at robotic engineering and computer programming as she is bad at parenting, which means she creates a technological singularity, the most advanced AI that humanity has ever seen, in the body of M3gan, a tiny, caucasian girl robot.

In an attempt to comfort Cady, Gemma fires off the platitude that “he’s in a better place.” Gemma, who again is bad at parenting, is also a terrible liar. Getting hit by a car and dying is not a better place than a cushy, affluent outdoor school in the Pacific Northwest.

It spirals from the death of Harry’s mother Princess Diana in 1997, across his stunted and laddish adolescence, through his manly army days and his marriage to Meghan Markle, and up to the point that he decided to step down as a senior member of the British royal family in 2020. ", "Throughout, Harry’s ghostwriter ", " channels Harry’s voice with disarming candor. Intimate details of royal life stream out unceasingly: the brown peat-sweetened water in the baths at Balmoral, the petty squabbles over parking spots at Kensington Palace, the miserly Windsor Christmas traditions.

His sentences are simple and sparse, often broken into single words. Harry (via Moehringer) introduces a Faulkner reference by noting that he found it on brainyquote.com, and he is charmingly overwhelmed by Meghan’s literary sophistication when she references ", ", a book Harry informs us he has never heard of. ", "More Harry’s speed, it seems, are stories about how he lost his virginity (an older woman behind a pub) and how his penis was frostbitten during a trek to the North Pole (“Now my South Pole is on the fritz”). These he presents to the reader with a sort of dirty wink, an establishing of his credentials as a lad’s lad who would certainly never want to get in the way of anyone’s good time.", "And yet even Harry, the subtext goes, can see that there is something badly wrong with the relationship between the British monarchy and the British press — especially when it comes to the way the British press treated Meghan, the British monarchy’s first member of color. So what’s everyone else’s excuse?", "What, especially, is the excuse of Harry’s father and brother, King Charles and Prince William, that fraught, fragile family unit left behind after Diana’s death? They are the people to whom Harry was at one point closest in the world, and from whom he is now estranged. His relationships with them, and with his lost mother, are the beating heart of ", ". ", "Harry writes with palpable tenderness about Charles and William, whom he calls Pa and Willy. (In turn, Charles calls Harry “darling boy,” and William calls Harry “Harold.”) Charles appears during Harry’s childhood as an absentmindedly sweet man who leaves notes on Harry’s pillow about how proud he is of him. Every morning, Charles does headstands in his underwear for physical therapy, and he is attached to his childhood teddy bear, which he totes around everywhere. Meanwhile, William, the only person who truly understands the trauma of Diana’s death and of growing up in the glare of paparazzi flashbulbs, is in the first section of the book a partner in crime, a comrade, the first person Harry turns to with problems large and small: both when one of Diana’s old friends writes a tell-all, and when one of Harry’s school friends convinces him to shave off all his hair. ", "Yet Charles and William are both, in Harry’s telling, corrupted by the force of the crown, which pushes them to prioritize their own reputations and consider Harry’s expendable. Heirs, always, over spares. ", "“I was brought into the world in case something happened to Willy,” he writes bluntly. “I was summoned to provide backup, distraction, diversion and, if necessary, a spare part. Kidney, perhaps. Blood transfusion. Speck of bone marrow.” In real life, William seems to be in little need of organ donations, but both he and Charles could always use something to take the pressure of the press’s attention off of them. Harry provides a handy distraction.", "To that end, Charles allows his office to form an alliance with a journalist who falsely reports that a teenage Harry has gone to rehab for his cocaine use. Rather than denouncing the story, they use it to make Charles look sympathetic as the harried single father to a teen addict. (Harry darkly sees the hand of Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles’s longtime mistress and now queen consort, at work here, as the source for the piece is a known Camilla ally.) ", "The pattern continues for decades, with Charles and Camilla continually prioritizing their own rehabilitation narrative over the reputations of their children, and justifying the practice because they are the ones closest to the throne. They even, Harry reports, try to pressure Kate to change her name from Catherine to Katherine so as to avoid having too many royal “C”s. (Kate apparently declined.)", "Meanwhile, William, Harry writes, is incensed with the way Harry gets to ignore the rules that regiment William’s own life: The heir must always be beyond reproach, but the spare gets to have fun. William has to shave his beard, but Harry gets to wear his even when in military uniform, in violation of protocol. William has to get married in his bright red Irish Guards uniform even though he prefers to wear the Household Cavalry frock coat uniform, but Harry gets to wear his uniform of choice to his own wedding. ", "To compensate for the loss of autonomy, Harry writes, William pulls rank constantly. As a teen, he tells Harry not to talk to him when they are both at Eton. As an adult, he seems put off that Meghan goes for a hug rather than a curtsy upon first meeting him. He squabbles over how he and Harry should split up their charitable concerns and tries to veto both Harry’s Invictus Games for wounded veterans and his environmental advocacy in Africa. “I let you have veterans,” he tells Harry, “why can’t you let me have African elephants and rhinos?”", "When the tabloids falsely report that Meghan made Kate cry during the lead-up to her wedding with Harry (the truth, ", ", is that Kate made Meghan cry), Harry traces the story to William, who fed it to Charles and Camilla, who fed it to the press. No correction, he writes, will ever be forthcoming from any of them, “because it would embarrass the future queen. The monarchy always, at all costs, had to be protected.”", "Later, Harry writes that William has grown suspicious of the enlightened new attitudes Harry espouses post-Meghan, and post-therapy (suggested by Meghan). He seems to feel almost abandoned, as though Harry has left him behind in the suffocating structure of the monarchy. He refuses to join Harry in therapy, calling him “brainwashed.” ", "In the midst of one argument, William throws Harry to the floor so forcefully that a dog food dish shatters below him. The act is both violently aggressive and oddly plaintive, like the last resort of a spurned lover. “Come on, we always used to fight,” William says. “You’ll feel better if you hit me.” Harry refuses. As William leaves, he asks Harry not to tell Meghan about the incident and says, “I didn’t attack you, Harold.” ", "As in all families, deep betrayals and petty nonsense seem to hold equal emotional weight for the Windsors. Harry is justly furious with Camilla for the public relations rehab maneuver, but he’s also angry that she converted one of his many old bedrooms into her dressing room after he moved out, and that she once seemed bored talking to him at afternoon tea. He’s glad she makes his father happy, but he resents her for taking Charles away from him, in the same way that he resents Kate, whom he seems to genuinely like, for taking William away from him.", "Harry is ambivalent not just about his family but also about the press, the central villain of this story and an object of fascination for him. He despises them, actively blames them for his mother’s death, compares the sound of a paparazzo’s clicking shutter to the sound of gunfire. He also reads their coverage obsessively, to the point that absorbing press coverage of the royal family seems to be his main hobby. He has nicknames for his least favorite journalists and follows the minutia of their careers with interest. When he bitterly mocks one reporter for starting two sentences in a row with the word “but” in a negative story written about him when he was 15 years old, he does so with the cadence of a man who’s been workshopping the bit in his head nonstop for multiple decades. A therapist suggests that he is addicted to the press, and he doesn’t dispute it. ", "The root trauma here is, of course, Diana: radiant, beloved, unreachable Diana. Harry was 12 years old when Diana died in a car crash in Paris. After her death, he had to march behind her coffin in a funeral procession while the world watched, and then shake hands and exchange pleasantries with the many mourners who had never met her, and whose hands were often, he writes in a striking detail, wet with their own tears. He himself only cried when Diana was interred, and then felt “ashamed of violating the family ethos.” Then he found himself unable to cry over her again until he was an adult.", "In ", ", Harry writes about Diana with a child’s idealization. In his prose, she is beyond saints, beyond goddesses. When he meets a woman who remembers Diana cuddling her on a charity visit when she was a small child, he is overwhelmed with jealousy. Trauma has gnawed holes into all his own memories of his mother.", "The army, in Harry’s narrative, both steadies and further traumatizes him. He feels that he grew up while on active duty, that he found his sense of purpose. (He believes wholeheartedly that the war in Afghanistan was just, although he notes that he doesn’t think the army was all that effective at swaying Afghan hearts and minds for the cause of Western democracy. He also makes a point of noting that he made sure each of the 25 people he killed were verified Taliban operatives and not civilians.) But after he returns from his tours, he begins to suffer from panic attacks every time he has to speak in public. Agoraphobia keeps him tethered to the tiny bachelor’s apartment his father has allotted him, watching ", " reruns and identifying with Chandler. ", "Things will be different, Harry thinks, when he is married. “You weren’t a fully vested member of the Royal Family, indeed a true human being, until you were wed,” he explains. After he’s married, he imagines, he won’t be afraid to go out in public, because his family will start to respect him. His grandmother will stop sticking him in the servant’s wing during holidays at Balmoral, because he’ll have more seniority. His father will up his allowance and give him a family home. He’ll get his beloved brother back, because he and William and Kate and whoever he marries will get to be couple friends together. And he’ll have, at long last, a partner, someone to replace the source of unconditional love he lost when his mother died.", "Instead, when Harry marries, Charles tells him that he can’t afford to support both him and the Cambridges. (Supporting his children, Harry notes with outrage, was supposed to be part of Charles’s job as Prince of Wales, not something he did “out of any largesse.” After all, being the sons of the Prince of Wales rendered both William and Harry unemployable.) William darkly repeats tabloid stories about Meghan being pushy and abrasive, while Kate flinches away from Meghan’s American friendliness. And Meghan is so badly harassed by racist tabloids that she begins to struggle with suicidal ideation.", "Harry does not explicitly blame the monarchy for any of these problems. In subtext, ", " is a searing indictment of the British crown, which Harry depicts as a force that warps family dynamics under the strength of its imperative: to protect the crown, and those in the direct line of succession, at the expense of everyone else. Yet textually, Harry declares his full-throated support for the monarchy and for his commander-in-chief. He writes lyrically of the “magic” of the crown itself, the beauty of its jewels, of how much he believes it means to the people of the British Commonwealth. ", "“The crown seemed to possess some inner energy source, something beyond the sum of its parts,” he writes, in an apparent attempt to square the difference. “But all I could think … was how tragic that it should remain locked up in this Tower.” The implication seems to be that the monarchy is strong and powerful and a force for good, but that it’s been hindered by forces that go too far to protect it. The idea appears nowhere else in ", ", and here it feels less than convincing.", " does not exist, though, for the monarchy. ", " exists, apparently, for William and Charles, the lost loves of Harry’s life, stolen from him by their wives, by the press, by the institution, by everything they chose before they chose him. He is writing and publishing ", ", he explains in the foreword, in order to explain to them why he felt he had to leave them and the rest of the family behind, to move to California and start over. ", "He can’t explain it to their faces, he writes. “It would take too long. Besides, they’re clearly not in the right frame of mind to listen. Not now, anyway. Not today. And so: Pa? Willy? World? Here you go.”", "The tragedy of ", " is that everything Harry has told us makes it clear that Charles and William will take this memoir not as an explanation or a love letter but as a betrayal worse than anything they ever did to Harry, and that they may not be wrong. Even if they never read it, as seems highly possible, how can they avoid the endless stream of coverage, the interviews Harry has granted about the book, the Netflix documentary that came in December, the nonstop stream of information about Harry and Meghan that the two of them have flung out into the world? You close the book with the queasy sense that in reading it, you’ve been prying into something deathly private, that probably this book should not exist at all.", "It’s as though Harry, who hates the press and its constant invasion of his privacy, has had to become press himself in order to finally bring the emotional force of his argument home.

Yet it also captures the insecurities of an administration that was left in anxiety over whether Donald Trump would try to stay in power after losing the 2020 election.

The concerns were shared by other top officials as well, and it’s ", " by other chroniclers of the Trump administration that Mark Milley, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi communicated concerns about Trump to each other. But as Whipple reports, Pelosi didn’t just talk to Milley about their shared anxieties; she also served as an intermediary between Milley and the Biden team during the transition. Biden’s concerns about the peaceful transition of power were so omnipresent before he took office that his advisers blamed it, in part, for contributing to the military’s botched withdrawal from Afghanistan.

He documents the Biden administration’s efforts to convince the Russians not to invade and Biden’s stalwart opposition to Putin afterward, which Whipple even compares to Winston Churchill’s defiance of Adolf Hitler during World War II. He chronicles the moment when the United States knew for certain that Putin would invade. On the eve of the attack, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin called Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to offer one more warning about what the Russians were claiming were military exercises near the Ukrainian border. Shoigu’s chilling response was simply, “Well, those troops won’t be there for much longer. I can assure you.” Less than a week later, Russia invaded. "]},

If her family moved to Texas, she said, “My son would still be growing up in an environment where those were the prevalent conversations around women and their bodies.” ", "Her family ultimately decided to move to New York instead of Texas. It wasn’t an easy choice to make. On some level, Kelly felt like she was caught between wanting to fight for the future of a state that she feels a deep connection to, and protecting her kids. And like nearly every woman Vox spoke to for this story, Kelly felt it was a privilege to be able to make any sort of decision about her and her family’s future, knowing that so many women will, because of these restrictions, find themselves with even fewer options. ", "While many women were considering what the decision would mean for their families, some also weighed how it might affect those who can’t have kids on their own. Emily Morey, a nurse from Maine, is a mother of two who delivered two more babies as a surrogate, most recently in January 2022. Emily loved being able to help other parents start their families. She felt it was a gift she was able to give other people, one she felt deeply gratified to provide. In Maine, abortions remained legal up to the ", ", but the state had an anti-abortion Republican as its governor until early 2019, and Emily felt strongly that her rights were now vulnerable to political interference. She decided she was done with surrogacy. ", "The decision was hard to make. “It was a really big part of my life, something that I wanted since I was very young. To be a mom, to be pregnant, to have babies, and to have babies for other people: it’s been so much of my life for such a long time. And to know, in that moment when I heard that the decision had come down, that it’s too risky, I cannot for any reason put myself in that position — it’s so sad and so hard to know that I didn’t get to pick when I was done.” ", "Emily thought of the other parents, who often spent years on waiting lists trying to find a surrogate. “It’s an immeasurable loss,” she said. “To know that those lines are getting longer, that those parents will have to wait longer and they may not be able to have children of their own because there isn’t a surrogate to help them, breaks my heart.” ", "Emily was now considering something else: tubal ligation. “It’s definitely not something I had made a plan for. It’s not something I had had a conversation with my doctor about. But now, it’s something I think about all the time. I have an upcoming visit with my OB-GYN to set up a surgical consult, because it’s time,” Emily said. “I hate to say it, I hate to think about it. But it’s time.”", "For some women who were pregnant when ", " was overturned, the decision created stress and feelings of precarity around pregnancy itself. Caitlyn, a 33-year-old product designer from Richmond, Virginia, found out she was pregnant at the beginning of June. The fall of ", " so early in her pregnancy “scared me shitless,” she said, as did the uncertainty over what would happen in Virginia, where Republicans have previously tried to restrict abortion, and the GOP governor, Glenn Youngkin, is ", ". Caitlyn wondered: If she miscarried early in the pregnancy, would there be time to get pregnant again before further restrictions on her right to an abortion were enacted? ", "Caitlyn and her husband started looking at the state’s legislative calendar to determine when new laws might be enacted. In Virginia, new state laws are generally introduced in January and go into effect in July. “I did not expect to be thinking about what the legislative landscape was going to be looking like when I was thinking about what decisions I was making for myself and my family. I just didn’t even think that I’d be here,” Caitlyn said.", "She and her husband knew they only wanted to have one child. The possibility of an abortion ban coming into place this year, though, led them to a difficult question. If this pregnancy didn’t work out, would they be willing to try again, knowing the possibility that new laws might prevent her from having an abortion if something went wrong? ", "“All of these different factors were the things we had to talk through,” she said. “And unfortunately, it means that this is the only shot for us, just given the priorities that we’ve set, which is: I’m just not willing to die for a couple of cells that are in my uterus,” Caitlyn said. “We decided this is going to be our only child, full stop. If we’re fortunate enough and she’s born healthy, that’s really exciting. And we’re really stoked. But if something goes wrong, this is the end of the line for us.” After they made their decision, Caitlyn’s husband got a ", ".

I mean, ultimately, I want her to be happy and I want her to be healthy. And I want her to be comfortable with whomever she is,” Caitlyn said. “The weight of knowing that the way that she’s going to grow up, the rights that she’s going to have, are going to be very different than my own experience — it’s scary, as a parent.

We’re still very much in the process of trying to figure that out.", "We certainly think it’s more than just this fungus gnawing away on some brain tissue because the behavior is so specific.", "If you compare it one-to-one with zombies from pop culture, it’s not completely accurate.

It’s also true that because there isn’t a lot of tough competition for Ticketmaster, the company doesn’t have much incentive to do better.

I think very few platforms would be ready for that type of volume,” Brown said. “At the same time, given the amount of money they pull in and the commitments they make to artists and the fact that they’re paying their CEOs … millions of dollars, they do not invest enough to maintain the platform at an adequate level.”", "Witt believes the ticketing market is ripe for disruption — but is held back by Ticketmaster’s dominance. “Ticketmaster has kept ticketing in the dark ages,” he said.", "When you are a giant corporation with as tight a grip on an industry as Live Nation Entertainment, you can kind of do — and not do — whatever you want.

The company often charges a litany of fees that don’t have a clear rhyme or reason (and generally don’t end up in the artist’s pocket). I recently went to buy tickets for a monster truck show in New Jersey (don’t worry about it) and was surprised to see the price of the two $20 tickets I was looking at had nearly doubled when I got to checkout, due to service fees, facility charges, and order processing fees. Those fees were also sort of hidden — I had to click a little drop-down arrow to see a breakdown beyond the total charge.

In Ticketmaster’s case, it apparently feels it doesn’t have to worry about undercutting competitors.", "In prepared testimony for the January Senate hearing, Live Nation Entertainment president and CFO Joe Berchtold said that in most cases venues set service and ticketing fees. It is worth noting that many venues are owned by or have exclusive agreements with Ticketmaster, and this points to a broader lack of transparency around what exactly is going on behind the scenes. When Vox inquired about the fee issue via email, Ticketmaster said venues “select a ticketer and help set fees and generally keep the majority of those fees” and didn’t provide further detail beyond Berchtold’s testimony. The company did not respond to follow-up questions regarding what it means to “help” set the fees or how fees on secondary ticket sales work.

", "A breakup wouldn’t fix everything. Ticketmaster’s stronghold over the ticketing industry long predates the Live Nation merger, and it would still have a lot of control in the primary and, increasingly, the secondary market. It also wouldn’t guarantee an end to any funny business between Ticketmaster and Live Nation. “Because they are the sole players in a space that have any substantial market share, they would still have no reason to not still collude and act like the same company,” Brown said.

The final agreement also explicitly acknowledges that countries must respect the rights of Indigenous groups as they seek to conserve more land.

", "2) How much of that money will wealthy nations give to developing countries? ", "3) Who will manage and distribute the money?", "Negotiations reached a tipping point last week when delegates from developing countries including Brazil, India, and Indonesia walked out of finance talks after reaching an impasse with rich nations. “Financing is always the achilles’ heel of every global agreement,” Florian Titze, a policy advisor at WWF Germany, said at a press conference earlier this month.

In 2010, at a similar UN biodiversity meeting, countries pledged to achieve 20 targets, known as the Aichi Targets, within a decade. And some of those targets sound a lot like those in the new framework — eliminating harmful subsidies is one of them, and halving the loss of natural habitats is another. ", "None of those targets were met. Not one. So, what will be different this time? ", "Countries failed to meet the Aichi Targets, experts say, for two main reasons: There was a dearth of funding for conservation, and there was no clear monitoring and reporting system to hold countries accountable. “If there’s one thing that we learned from Aichi it’s that you need to monitor,” Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity, said in a press conference last week. ", "With that in mind, delegates in Montreal also negotiated a plan to measure progress toward each target, using a series of indicators, and to report on that progress every few years. In some cases, those indicators are straightforward, such as a tally of all square kilometers of the Earth that are conserved (which is already available in ", "); others are not yet fully developed, such as indicators for corporate disclosures. ", "But together with a steep hike in financing, delegates and environmental advocates generally believe that the new monitoring framework will help countries avoid complete failure. ", "For some delegates, money remains a concern. ", "Early Monday morning, when adoption of the biodiversity framework seemed imminent, a delegate from the Democratic Republic of the Congo took to the floor and explained that he could not support the deal. Forest-rich developing nations need more aid and it must be easy to access, he said. Ultimately, the delegate only briefly stalled the adoption process, but his dissent highlighted that, even after several days of late-night negotiations, not everyone is satisfied. ", "Some goals and targets also lack specificity, according to some environmental advocates. Countries should, for example, commit to increasing animal populations by a certain percentage, but an exact number doesn’t appear anywhere in the current agreement, according to Georgina Chandler, a senior international policy officer at The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. ", "Again, there’s also a question of accountability because the agreement isn’t legally binding. Plus, it lacks a clear process for “ratcheting up” or raising the ambition of targets at regular intervals. ", "Yet there are plenty of other, non-legal tools to keep countries on the right track, according to Andrew Deutz, director of global policy, institutions, and conservation finance at The Nature Conservancy. A lot of it simply comes down to peer pressure, he said. “It becomes a name and shame, but also a highlight and reward,” he said — in other words, calling out countries that are behind, and praising those that are on track to hit the targets. ", "Ultimately, there’s no guarantee that this framework will work. But several people I spoke to in Montreal emphasized that it ", "to.

A kind of orchid, for example, convincingly mimics the scent and shape of a female thynnid wasp. As the wasp attempts to mate with the flower, it gets covered in pollen, helping the plant reproduce with other orchids far away. ", "No mimicry, however, is quite like that of Boquila trifoliolata, as far as scientists understand. It’s one thing to evolve to look like another organism, like the orchid. It’s another to evolve the ability", "to mimic several different organisms, changing as you grow. ", "When Gianoli first published his discovery, back in 2014, he could only guess how the vine does its thing. He suggested that Boquila trifoliolata might be picking up chemicals in the air emitted by nearby plants or even obtaining some genetic material from the plants themselves that contain information about leaf shape and size. ", "Earlier this year, however, a ", " in the journal ", "presented an alternative, eyebrow-raising theory: B. trifoliolata uses a primitive form of vision to mimic other plants. The plant can, in a sense, see, the authors claimed.", "Scientists have long known that plants have photoreceptors and can detect the presence of light, often in highly sophisticated ways. They can, for example, sense the color and direction of a beam, according to Simon Gilroy, a professor of botany at the University of Wisconsin Madison. That’s what the telegraph plant is doing when it swivels its leaves toward the light.", "But the new study, led by Felipe Yamashita, a doctoral student at the University of Bonn, takes this a giant step further. It suggests that B. trifoliolata uses lens-like cells in its leaves, or “ocelli,” to detect the shape and other attributes of nearby plants. Then, it somehow processes that information and uses it to form new leaves in their image. ", "Yamashita and his co-author, Jacob White (who’s not a scientist but raises plants at home), tried to test this by growing the mimic vine next to plastic plants. Their thinking was that if B. trifoliolata uses a form of vision for its mimicry, it should be able to copy any old plastic plant. And sure enough, it could, according to the study. “Leaves of B. trifoliolata mimicked leaves of the artificial plant,” it notes plainly.", "There’s just one problem with that conclusion: Mainstream plant biologists don’t buy it. ", "Several scientists told Vox that there are significant issues with the study design. The authors didn’t adequately control variables that can influence leaf shape, such as the age of the leaves, for example, they said. Mainstream researchers also challenge the underlying theory of plant vision. Certain plant cells may be able to act like lenses that can focus light, but they likely can’t create any sort of detailed pictures. ", "“I am very skeptical of this work, to say the least,” said Lincoln Taiz, a professor emeritus at the University of California Santa Cruz and co-editor of the textbook Plant Physiology and Development. “The idea that the ‘ocelli’ behave like little eyes that can construct an image of a leaf that would enable a plant to mimic that leaf is far-fetched.” (Yamashita said he’s used to criticism because his work challenges mainstream science. He added that his recent study was just one experiment and plant vision remains only a theory that needs more support.)", "Taiz and other mainstream scientists also dispute the broader way of thinking about plant intelligence that vision fits into. A small group of researchers known as plant neurobiologists believe that plants have a form of consciousness and self-awareness. Some of them — including Yamashita’s academic adviser, Frantisek Baluska — have also ", " that plants have bundles of neuron-like cells in parts of their roots that function as a “brain-like command centre.” It’s there that plants could process visual information, Baluska told me. ", "To support this idea, Baluska, an editor-in-chief of the journal ", ", where the new study was published, points to several features of plant cells that he says are similar to neurons. He claims, for example, that they use the same neurotransmitters for communication as animals like glutamate and GABA, and communicate with synapses. He also shared studies showing how plants are susceptible to anesthesia — Venus flytraps, for example, won’t close when they’re anesthetized — to suggest that certain plant cells may be similar to human neurons. ", "But according to Taiz, “it’s no surprise” to find these neurotransmitters in plants. Their evolutionary presence in life predates animals and nervous systems. There’s also no clear evidence of synapses in plant cells, according to a recent ", " he co-authored, which includes several other reasons why such a brain-like structure couldn’t exist. ", "(As for the effect of anesthetics: These chemicals can inhibit plant movement simply by disrupting the flow of ions and water in plants, Taiz said, so their effects don’t prove that plants have animal-like nervous systems. Baluska said researchers including Taiz have been “attacking” his theories for years now and pointed Vox to his ", " to their critiques.) ", "A common thread in the theories of plant neurobiology is that plants are sentient beings that share certain features with higher-order organisms like humans. And from that perspective, it’s easy to imagine that plants might see their world the way that we do. But according to Taiz, “the vast majority of mainstream plant scientists do not give the work of ‘plant neurobiologists’ much credence.”", "The idea of vines with eyes is fun, yet the more mainstream theory behind mimicry is arguably just as exciting. Gianoli and some other researchers believe that B. trifoliolata’s mimicry might be rooted in the rich communities of bacteria and other microbes that live in and around plants. ", "You can think of plants as mini ecosystems that harbor a wide diversity of microbial life, not unlike an old tree in a forest that’s home to monkeys and lizards and bugs. These microbes — which scientists know little about — play a large role in the life of a plant, affecting its ability to feed, grow, and fight pathogens. Remarkably, ", " that microbes can even control which genes in a plant’s DNA are turned on, in some cases helping them survive in harsh conditions, such as salty soil.", "Normally, Gianoli theorizes, those microbes mainly influence the life and genes of the plants they live on. It’s as though each plant and its bacterial community are a family that share a unique language that other plants can’t understand, he said. Boquila trifoliolata, however, may be able to speak multiple languages — in other words, the vine may be affected by the microbes that live on multiple other plants. Key to his theory, those microbes may control the appearance of leaves.", "Put simply: This hypothesis does not imply that B. trifoliolata is “seeing” but rather suggests that microbes are helping to shape the plant’s leaves. ", "If that’s not strange enough, Gianoli says those microbes may also be transferring some of the plant’s own DNA to the mimic vine in the process, through a complicated mechanism known as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT. (HGT is a ", " and utterly fascinating phenomenon, whereby genes are passed between unrelated organisms. Some bacteria, for example, give plants genes that make them form galls, or tumors, that they use.) ", "This is only a theory, and a pretty fringe one — we’re talking about invisible, microbial forces affecting the shape of leaves, perhaps to help a plant hide. In a ", " published last year, however, Gianoli did find some evidence that microbes are involved in mimicry. The paper, published in the ", "journal ", "revealed similarities between the communities of bacteria living inside the foliage of a tree and the leaves of B. trifoliolata that ", " that tree. ", "“Our results suggest the involvement of bacterial agents in leaf mimicry,” Gianoli and his coauthors wrote in the paper. “Yet we are still far from proving the HGT hypothesis.”", "So scientists have yet to figure out how plants mimic other plants. In the coming months, Gianoli will carry out new studies to pinpoint which genes are activated in B. trifoliolata’s genome when it mimics another plant, he said. Yamashita is also planning more experiments and is trying to propagate the plant in the lab. There’s nothing wrong with laying out big or far-fetched hypotheses, as long as you test them, said Haswell of Washington University in St. Louis. That’s what moves science forward. ", "What can be a problem, however, is to start with the idea that plants possess animal-like intelligence, according to Haswell and other researchers. While humans have a tendency to see ourselves in other organisms — whether they’re ", " or trees — that perspective doesn’t get us closer to actually understanding those creatures or how they see the world. (Maybe trees ", " actually talking underground.)", "“We are scientists, and we have to admit when we’re wrong,” Gianoli said. “But we don’t have to be too anthropocentric or soul-centric, expecting that plants have to be like animals or like humans. They don’t have to have eyes because they don’t need eyes. They have other sensory systems.”", "Those sensory systems are pretty incredible on their own. Boquila trifoliolata can literally shape-shift! Orchids can trick wasps into thinking they’re wasps! Grass can call in flying reinforcements! So perhaps plants aren’t neat because they’re like us, but because they’re so different. "]},

So if you’re a psychologist, you’re thinking about what questions to ask participants and how to word them and what order to put them in and so on. And if you have a truth-seeking orientation during that process, where you’re constantly asking, “What is the way to do this that best arrives at the truth?” then I think you’ll tend to produce good research. Whereas if you have other motivations, like “What will make a cool-looking finding?” or “What will get published?” then I think you’ll make decisions suboptimally. ", "And so one of the things that these good practices like open science do is they help create greater alignment between truth-seeking and what the researcher is doing. But they’re not perfect. There’s so many ways in which you can be misaligned. ", "Okay, so thinking about different efforts that have been put forth to address replication issues, like preregistration, what makes you hopeful that your effort will succeed where others might have fallen short?", "Our project is really quite different. With previous projects, what they’ve done is go back and look at papers and go try to replicate them. This gave us a lot of insight — like, my best guess from looking at all those prior big replication studies is that in top journals, about 40 percent of papers don’t replicate. ", "But the thing about those studies is that they don’t shift incentives going forward. What really makes the Transparent Replications project different is that we’re trying to change forward-looking incentives by saying: Whenever a new psychology paper or behavior paper comes out in ", " and ", ", as long as they are within our technical and monetary constraints, we will replicate them. So imagine you’re submitting your paper and you’re like, “Oh, wait a minute, I’m going to get replicated if this gets published!” That actually makes a really big difference. Right now the chance of being replicated is so low that you basically just ignore it. ", "Talk to me about the timeline here. How soon after a paper gets published would you release your replication results? And is that quick enough to change the incentive structure?", "Our goal would be to do everything in 8 to 10 weeks. We want it to be fast enough that we can avoid stuff getting into the research literature that may not turn out to be true. Think about how many ideas have now been shared in the literature that other people are citing and building on that are not correct! ", "We’ve seen examples of this, like with ", " [the theory that when a task requires a lot of mental energy, it depletes our store of willpower]. Hundreds of papers have been written on it, and yet now there’s doubts about whether it’s really legitimate at all. It’s just an incredible waste of time and energy and resources. So if we can say, “This new paper came out, but wait, it doesn’t replicate!” we can avoid building on it.", "Running replications in 8 to 10 weeks — that’s fast. It sounds like a lot of work. How big of a team do you have helping with this? ", "My colleague Amanda Metskas is the director of the project, and then we have a couple other people who are helping. It’s just four of us right now. But I should say we’ve spent years building the experience to run rapid studies. We actually build technology around studies, like our platform ", " recruiting people for studies in 100 countries. So if you need depressed people in Germany or people with sleep problems in the US or whatever, the platform helps you find that. So this is sort of our bread and butter.", "Another extremely important thing is, our replications have to be extremely accurate, so we always run them by the original research team. We really want to make sure it’s a fair replication of what they did. So we’ll say, “Hey, your paper is going to be replicated, here is the exact replication that’s going to be done, look at our materials.” I think all the teams have gotten back to us and they’ve given minor comments. And after we write the report, we send it to the research team and ask if they see any errors. We give them a chance to respond.", "But if for some reason they don’t get back to us, we’re still going to run the replication!", "So far you’ve done ", ", which are scoring pretty well on transparency and clarity. Two of them scored okay on replicability, but one basically failed to replicate. I’m curious, especially for that one, have you gotten a negative reaction? Have the researchers been defensive? What’s the process been like on a human level?", "We’re really grateful because all the research teams have communicated with us, which is awesome. That really helps us do a better job. But I do not know how that research team is going to react. We have not heard anything since we sent them the final version. ", "Broadly, what do you think the consequences should be for bad research? Should there be consequences other than how frequently it’ll be cited by other scientists? ", "No. Failing to replicate really should not be seen as an indictment of the research team. Every single researcher will sometimes have their work fail to replicate. Like, even if you’re the perfect researcher. So I really think the way to interpret it is not, “This research team is bad,” but, “We should believe this result less.” ", "In an ideal world, it just wouldn’t get published! Because really what should happen is that the journals should be doing what we’re doing. The journals — like ", " and ", " — should be saying, well, we’re going to replicate a certain percentage of the papers. ", "That would be incredible. It would change everything. And then we could stop doing this!", "You just put your finger on exactly what I wanted to ask you, which is … it seems a bit ridiculous to me that a group like yours has to go out, raise money, do all this work. Should it actually be the journals that are doing this? Should it be the NIH or NSF that are randomly selecting studies that they fund for replication follow-ups? I mean, just doing this as part of the cost of the basic process of science — whose job should it actually be?", "I think it would be amazing if the journals did it. That would make a lot of sense because they’re already engaging at a deep level. It could be the funder as well, although they may be in not as good a position to do it, since it’s less in their wheelhouse. ", "But I would say being independent from academia puts us in a unique position to be able to do this. Because if you’re going to do a bunch of replications, if you’re an academic, what is the output of that? You have to get a paper out of it, because that’s how you advance your career — that’s the currency. But the top journals don’t tend to publish replications. Additionally, some of these papers are coming from top people in the field. If you fail to replicate them, well, you might worry: Is that going to make them think badly of you? Is it going to have career repercussions? ", "Can you say a word about your funding model going forward? Where do you think the funding for this is going to come from in the long haul?", "We set up a ", " because some people might just want to support this scientific endeavor. We’re also very likely going to be going to foundations, especially ones that are interested in meta-science, and see if they might be interested in giving. We want this to be an indefinite project, until others who should be doing it take it over. And then we can stop doing our work, which would be awesome. "]},

", "Why is everyone so sick, so simultaneously? One explanation that’s gotten a lot of airtime is the concept of “immunity debt,” coined by a group of French pediatric infectious disease experts in an August 2021 ", ". ", "A central premise of immunity debt is that for many infectious diseases, repeat infections are milder than the first infection. The authors hypothesized that after several pandemic years during which masks, distancing, and ventilation protected so many people from initial infections with a range of viruses, more people than usual would be catching certain diseases for the first — and worst — time now that those protections are not as strongly in place.

Inaccurate interpretations of the concept suggest its originators think the pandemic era somehow ", ", and are being used to ", " the wisdom of masking, school closures, vaccines, and other mitigation measures that saved lives.", "In fact, the fundamentals of immunity debt make a lot of sense, immunologists and infectious disease experts told me. While the term is new, the concepts it describes are actually well-trodden ideas in epidemiology. ", "There are still lots of unanswered questions about why respiratory viral dynamics have taken the shape they have over the past few months and years. For now, here’s what we know about the concept, and how it can be dangerously misinterpreted. ", "When we think of debt, most of us think of a deficit, a lack or low supply of something. It might be more intuitive to instead understand this phenomenon as a surplus of susceptible people, especially children", "That is to say: In pre-pandemic times, young children would be exposed to and develop some immunity to a variety of infections in just the first few years of life. During the pandemic, children were still being born — but they ", " ", " at nearly the same rate. That means that in many parts of the world, there are nearly three years’ worth of new children with relatively naive, and therefore vulnerable, immune systems, explained Ron Dagan, a doctor and researcher who specializes in pediatric respiratory infections at Israel’s Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. ", "“A whole cohort is born without exposure, so all of them will be having much lower antibodies than normal — so there will be much more susceptibility to infections,” Dagan said.  ", "There are a few reasons for this immunological naivete, some of them obvious. Social distancing and masking meant that many babies born during this time simply didn’t have contact with the usual number of other children who might have been sick. For a year, many kids didn’t go to school or day care — places where they traditionally encounter lots of infections. And even though many schools and day cares opened up in the fall of 2021, many had mask mandates in place for staff and children ", ", when opening windows and moving class outdoors were least likely to be used as preventive measures.", "But other reasons for lower protection levels have more to do with lower levels of infection in adults — specifically, pregnant adults. During the first year of life, most of babies’ infection protection comes in the form of antibodies passed on to them naturally during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The degree of protection newborns have corresponds to their birthing", "parent’s level of protection.", "“If you’re born to mothers with higher antibody levels, you will be more protected,” said Dagan. ", "For the first two and a half years of the pandemic — before companies began requiring employees to ", " ", ", and before other pandemic-era measures became far less commonly used — pregnant people, like other adults, ", ".  ", "Due to systemic inequities, that reprieve ", " by all Americans. Still, on a population level, many of the babies born during those years didn’t receive as many antibodies during pregnancy or breastfeeding — and were therefore born more vulnerable to common infections.", "Several of the experts I spoke with thought that most of the sick children currently being hospitalized would probably have been hospitalized in 2020 or 2021 if they’d been infected back then. In other words, they said, what makes the current hospitalization surge so large is that it represents a backlog of severe infections that, while inevitable, would have caused less of an onslaught if it had been spread out over two-plus years.  ", "All told, the population is more vulnerable to widespread transmission of some respiratory viruses. And because infections in people without immunity are usually more severe than in people with some immunity, that translates to more people at risk of getting sicker when they catch what would otherwise be a casual winter cold. However, it does not mean our individual immune systems are weak or “out of practice,” say ", ".", "This is the key source of confusion, experts tell me. While past colds and illnesses from previous seasons can protect us from current outbreaks conditions, there really isn’t such thing as a “good cold.” We shouldn’t seek out sickness for ourselves or our children. When you go looking for viruses, you never know what you’re going to catch.  ", "Remember the hygiene hypothesis? That’s the ", " that overly clean environments prevent healthy children’s immune systems from getting the “education” they need to respond adequately to infectious organisms. Without that education, goes the theory, the immune system compensates by overreacting, leading children to ", ", asthma, and other problems of immune system dysregulation. ", "In many people’s imaginations, the hygiene hypothesis means the more colds children are exposed to early in life, the more protective their immune systems are later in life. But there are very real risks with taking an open-door approach to catching colds, said Steven Varga, an immunologist at the University of Iowa who studies viral respiratory infections.  ", "For starters, when it comes to respiratory viruses, you never know what you’re breathing in: a mild virus that will cause a few days of snot, or something more deadly. It’s impossible to game out getting a mild infection, said Varga. “You can’t prevent one kind of respiratory tract infection and allow the others to go through,” he said. ", "If people are unprotected against less virulent pathogens like rhinovirus, for example, they’re also unprotected against viruses that can cause real damage, like RSV and SARS-CoV-2. That creates threats to those known to be at risk for severe infection from these viruses, like older and immunocompromised people. ", "Again, trying to get sick on purpose is a dangerous game of roulette. However, Varga cautioned that it’s impossible to predict who will get super-sick with a pathogen — even healthy people can get unexpectedly and severely ill. The vast majority of kids hospitalized for RSV are ", ", he said. “We can’t predict with any great certainty who is at increased risk for that more severe disease.” ", "There are also misconceptions, the researchers say, about which microbes help “train” our immune system most effectively. It’s not respiratory viruses like the cold and flu.", "Rather, it’s the billions of microbes that live peacefully in our bodies, sometimes called the microbiome, said Marsha Wills-Karp, an immunologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies the environmental determinants of allergic airway diseases. ", "Within that microbiome, there are many “teachers,” like bacteria that ", " infants’ immune systems to develop ", ", the B-cell factories that contribute to antibody production, or that ", " and other immune cells to respond to pathogenic invaders (i.e., germs).", "A lot of work that’s supported the hygiene hypothesis suggests that most of the microbiome’s important immune system education ", " — and, therefore, that what kids swallow contributes more to their immune development than what they breathe in.", "Additionally, it’s not currently clear ", " — largely because most microbiome work has been on bacteria. ", "There is a small microbiome in the upper airways and the lungs, but it’s much less diverse than the digestive tract’s, said Wills-Karp. Although the respiratory microbiome does play a role in health and disease states, “in population studies and animal studies, the hygiene hypothesis seems to be more linked to a healthy gut microbiome,” she said. ", "The bottom line here: There’s currently not much evidence to support the idea that adding more viruses to a person’s respiratory tract does anything to improve the immune system or to otherwise improve health. ", "Wills-Karp recommends training young immune systems the way you might train a young football player: with players you know they can handle. Kids should run drills with other players their own size, not with an NFL team, “because there’s more potential for you to get hurt with the big boys,” she said. Similarly, immune systems should get trained on the safe environmental and comestible microbes that live in our guts — exposures children and adults get anyway by living in non-sterile environments, but which are enriched by certain factors like ", " ", " ", " and eating ", " and ", " foods.  ", "Instead of relying on direct exposure for the little protection it might provide, a safer bet is to train our immune systems using vaccines whenever we can. Flu and Covid-19 vaccines are available now, and ", " will likely be approved within the next few years. ", "Also a safer bet — for immune systems young, old, and everywhere in between — is not getting sick to begin with. Wearing masks, maximizing our indoor air’s ", ", and other pandemic-era strategies prevent more than just Covid-19.", "There are still a ton of unanswered questions about respiratory viruses and how they impact our health later in life. A big one surrounds ", ": Babies with bad RSV infections are more likely to go on to develop asthma, but the medical community has never fully understood whether the infection causes the asthma, or instead, whether the factors that predispose a child to asthma make severe RSV more likely. ", "Other big questions revolve around the cause, treatment, and overall footprint of post-viral syndromes like long Covid, and the role (if any) of ", " — meaning, when one viral infection reduces or enhances the severity of a second viral infection — in respiratory virus trends. But one of the most pressing questions, said Dagan, involves what we can expect from these pathogens in the near term. Will next year bring another explosive respiratory virus season? Right now it’s impossible to say. ", "We do know the immunity boost that follows infections with RSV and certain flu strains is probably only enough to protect people for about a year afterward. But overall, viral outbreaks are easier to explain in retrospect than they are to predict (although, it should be noted, the authors of the “immunity debt” paper did accurately foretell the current RSV surge).", "“We don’t know how these viruses will behave in the next two or three years,” or what the SARS-CoV-2 virus will look like a year from now, and whether any changes might portend different impacts on children and adults, he said. “There are too many questions that we can ask — and every answer brings you more questions.”"]},

That means more eyes are watching and there will be more accountability. ", "“We already have lost half of the forests, half of the coral reefs, 80 percent of the wetlands,” Lambertini said. “All this will only get worse unless we change the way we live, produce, and consume — in other words, unless we rebalance our relationship with nature.

The way he sees it, “banks are coercing capital away” from coal, gas, and oil industries. He explains he doesn’t want the coal- and gas-reliant state to contract its financial services with a company that is “trying to diminish those dollars. They want less coal mining, they want less fracking.”", "This is getting much bigger than BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, companies that used to be solidly at the right of corporate America. There are real stakes for pensioners, red-state taxpayers, and the wider economy if the GOP succeeds in scaring off financial institutions from pursuing climate targets. ", "The backlash began early in 2021 when three events sent the signal that ESG was here to stay. The first was Larry Fink’s embrace of ESG, noting in ", " that “No issue ranks higher than climate change on our clients’ lists of priorities. They ask us about it nearly every day.” The second came in March, when the Biden administration ", " to require climate risk disclosure from publicly traded companies, parallel to ", " adopted by the European Union.", "The third and final was an unlikely coup staged at the annual Exxon shareholder board meeting. ", "Last year,", "Engine No. 1, a small hedge fund, earned enough votes to gain three Exxon board seats, despite the company’s recommendation against it. It wouldn’t have been possible without the support of Exxon’s three largest shareholders, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street voting, representing 20 percent of the voting share. The new board members’ mission was focused on understanding the risks climate change and regulation will pose to the company. ", "The win was the clearest sign yet that there was a realignment happening in financial markets and that even the fossil fuel industry couldn’t ignore the effects of climate change. Investors, as the Engine No. 1 win showed, are already clamoring for this kind of information. The assets BlackRock handles far outnumber what Republicans could divest. For example, two-thirds of BlackRock’s largest clients in its strategic partner program, representing ", ", support the energy transition, according to BlackRock.  ESG isn’t going away — by 2025, global ESG assets are expected to make up a ", "projected assets under management — and it keeps growing. ESG funds are also now ", " like for retirement savings.", "On the left, ESG has for years come under criticism as a form of greenwashing, and ESG disclosure isn’t the same thing as corporate behavior. As ", " noted, the funding in ESG is “dedicated to assuring returns for shareholders, not delivering positive planetary impact.” Many environmentalists think ESG is a distraction from the main issue they’d like to see traction on: companies disclosing the impact their products and investments have on the world around them, and accounting for that in decisions. ", "ESG doesn’t go this far. In no way will disclosure be enough to save the planet from climate change. There are no binding requirements, either. But what Republican critics of ESG really fear is that the financial world will realign with climate science and no longer see new coal plants and offshore drilling as viable projects to finance. ", "Many of the Republican attacks on ESG stem from a misrepresentation of what it actually means. It’s not always motivated by an altruistic climate or social", "agenda. ESG also helps banks and public companies meet their one goal by screening investments for various risks. “They’ve got a fiduciary duty to generate returns. So they’re not going to impose some agenda, whether it’s climate or social agenda, that’s going to get in the way of returns,” said University of Oxford business expert Robert Eccles. ", "As baseless as the attacks have been, the pressure could still work. Vanguard on Wednesday announced it is withdrawing from the Net Zero Asset Managers coalition, in which companies voluntarily committed to reaching net-zero emissions in their portfolios by 2050. In an apparent nod to the ongoing GOP’s investigations, ", " it withdrew “so that we can provide the clarity our investors desire about the role of index funds and about how we think about material risks, including climate-related risks — and to make clear that Vanguard speaks independently on matters of importance to our investors.”", "After Engine No. 1’s coup, the attacks started to crystallize from the right, spearheaded by conservative advocacy circles. There have been two groups at the center of these attacks, ", " by the Federalist Society’s Leonard Leo, who led the right’s legal strategy to ", ". Those groups, ", " and State Financial Officers Foundation, are conservative nonprofits also funded by groups with anonymous funding.", "These groups’ involvement suggests a deep-pocketed campaign. “This is an artificially created conversation topic that’s not being led by financial stakeholders. It’s political stakeholders that are driving this forward,” said Jacey Bingler, senior communications campaigner of the climate finance advocacy group Sunrise Project. ", "There have been four main prongs to the right’s strategy. Republicans plan to undertake antitrust investigations next year at the state and federal levels against", "these giant corporations. Just before the election, Senate Republicans ", " warning of investigations around ESG, claiming they suspect collusion. The second is what states like West Virginia and Florida have already done: pulling their state operating funds from BlackRock and other banks’ management. ", "The final two prongs are considered potentially the most damaging to taxpayers and pensioners in red states. One is the ", " that is circulating in red states, called the State Government Employee Retirement Protection Act. It divests teachers, police officers, state-employed nurses, and other employees’ pensions from companies that are on a boycott list. Eventually, experts worry this ban could mean the pensions are overweighted in fossil fuels and less diverse, leaving the people depending on their retirement subject to more market volatility. ", "The final tactic is a boycott list, where the state only seeks contracts with financing from companies that do not consider climate change in their calculations. Practically speaking, that means if a state wants to build a highway and needs financing, it could wind up being charged higher fees because there is less need for those banks to compete with better deals. ", "It’s not clear what’s motivating this new front in the GOP’s culture wars. It’s not a winning political issue, given that most voters aren’t familiar with terms like ESG, nor is ESG a top priority of the climate movement.  ", "There’s another theory, though. “It’s intended to delay climate action without having to admit that that’s what they’re attempting to do,” Sunrise’s Bingler said. “Republicans have essentially created a new installment in this culture war where they tend to pick relatively niche topics that don’t necessarily resonate with large parts of society without this artificial attempt to continue to fan the flames.”", "For over a decade, the main plank of the GOP has ignored climate science, cycling through ", " not to take action on greenhouse gas emissions.", "Most of the electorate thinks ", "and is concerned to some degree about it, and rising extreme weather is making it more undeniable. ", "But many Republican leaders don’t recognize that science. West Virginia’s treasurer, Moore, is one of them.", "“You’re talking about climate changing, you know, in 100 years,” he said. “I mean, these folks are hedging on what the climate might look like in 100 years. Tell me, exactly, for a pension beneficiary, who is going to retire in the next 10 years, how carbon emissions is going to affect the financial outcomes and vitality of a given publicly traded company.”", "“So what you’re telling me is you’re going to have sea levels rise by X amount of centimeters in 100 years, and that somehow is going to affect the profitability of a company?” he continued. “Not sure I follow that.”", "Climate activists — and even some investors — have said that the GOP pushback against ESG is a political issue, not primarily an economic one.", "There’s also no clear anti-ESG consensus among typical allies of Republicans; the Kentucky Bankers Association in November ", " the state attorney general for overstepping his authority by demanding documents related to ESG.", "So the issue’s salience in the next two years will depend entirely on how it resonates with voters and potentially factors into the presidential election. Many experts were skeptical it could ever gain political relevance, but still worry what the endgame is. Does this mean a future of “blue banks” and “red banks”? Will financial behemoths be frightened into weakening already-weak climate targets? It’s too early to say. ", "But the right’s war on banks won’t necessarily drive a back-pedaling on climate goals. BlackRock has tempered its interest in climate publicly since the ESG attacks began, but other institutions have pushed ahead. ", "“Market participants will continue to demand ESG data and incorporate it in risk models,” said Ivan Frishberg, chief sustainability officer of ", ", a bank with a socially responsible mission. “That is capitalism doing what it does best: seeking more data for better client responsiveness and a more systemic view. The pushback on ESG is essentially a denial of capitalism. Ultimately, our clients are going to drive the products and approaches we take and guide how we respond as a firm.”"]},

The Kilauea volcano, the most active volcano in the world and one that has been slowly dribbling out lava off and on since 1983, is a case in point.", "It’s one of the best-studied volcanoes in the world, and geologists knew that a larger eruption was possible. In 2018, they were able to read some warning signs ahead of that surge in activity and anticipate how it would play out.

", "“They have all made announcements of sorts and proclaim loads of new money for renewables,” ", ", a professor at the University of Cape Town and the former head of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, told Vox in an email. “The real picture though is that there is over-promising and under-delivery for these transitions.” ", "Development banks and international funding groups like the ", " have dialed back their financing of fossil fuels in developing countries in recent years, slowing the construction of new power plants running on coal and natural gas. The ", " says it “no longer supports traditional fossil fuel energy projects.”", "Meanwhile, some wealthy countries have ", " and ", " in recent months following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing turmoil in global energy markets. Many governments are also eager to give their economies a boost with cheap fuel as they emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic. ", "The situation now is that rich countries are ramping up their use of the dirtiest fuels, while poorer countries are finding it harder than ever to extract, use, and sell their own resources. Effectively, it’s shifting the burden of reducing greenhouse emissions to those least able to afford it. That’s why some argue that the world’s poorest countries should receive more money to pursue their energy ambitions, regardless of the fuel source.  ", "The core injustice of climate change is that the people who often stand to suffer the most from the effects of rising temperatures contributed the fewest greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, those that burned the most fossil fuels have accumulated the wealth to insulate themselves from many of the consequences of climate change.", "Between factors like sea level rise and higher temperatures, climate change has already rendered ", ". Coping with these effects is energy-intensive and expensive. More frequent and intense heat waves have made ", " in some regions. And for developing countries, this is all happening on top of existing poverty, inequality, and the legacies of past exploitation.  ", "Another factor is that the fossil fuel power plants and infrastructure already in place in poorer countries were often built by multinational corporations headquartered in rich countries or by the very development banks now turning against them. Now governments like the European Union are considering policies like a ", ", which would impose tariffs on goods from countries with dirtier energy sources.

So fossil fuels go furthest in improving the standard of living and quality of life in countries that have the least energy to begin with.", ", director for energy and development at the Breakthrough Institute, co-authored a report earlier this year titled “", ",” laying out some of the dramatic inequalities in contributions to climate change. The 64 poorest countries in the world, home to a quarter of the world’s population, account for 4.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Projecting to 2035, even if these countries increased their fossil fuel use, they would still contribute only a tiny slice of global greenhouse gas emissions. ", "“These are not the countries that should be penalized for their carbon emissions,” said Ramachandran. “The poorest countries should be given the most flexibility in terms of their energy choices so that they can focus on alleviating poverty, which is by far their biggest problem.”", "This doesn’t necessarily mean that fossil fuels are the best choice for all these countries, according to Ramachandran, but that foreclosing the option by restricting financing or imposing penalties is unjust. ", "It also doesn’t imply that fossil fuels and cleaner energy sources are mutually exclusive. In many cases, renewable energy alone isn’t practical or sufficient to meet energy needs. However, strategically deploying energy sources like natural gas could make it easier and more cost-effective to use variable wind and solar power, adding up to an overall reduction in greenhouse gases. ", "The United States is a case in point. For roughly the past 20 years, the United States has managed to grow its economy while reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. This was mainly due to switching from coal power to natural gas, which produces roughly ", " per quantity of energy. It’s cheaper, too, and generators that burn natural gas can more readily ramp up and down, filling in on calm, cloudy days when renewable power drops off. “It’s not a zero-sum game for renewables,” Ramachandran said. ", "For countries like South Africa, which gets ", ", this type of fuel switching could yield even larger economic and environmental dividends. ", "Natural gas from Africa could help other countries, too. Germany, which recently ", ", is looking to ", " and helping develop gas fields off the Senegalese coast.

", "Fossil fuels can therefore help developing countries increase their energy access and lift millions out of poverty while doing little to make climate change worse. It could then make sense to help these regions build out their coal, oil, and gas infrastructure in the near term. ", "“Until the larger issues are addressed, Africans in particular will have to claim the right to be pragmatic: go where there is money flowing since the priority for them is energy access and baseload [power generation] capabilities,” Lopes said.", "Still, while fossil fuels can boost energy access and accelerate economic development, there are a lot of good reasons much of the world is trying to do away with them. Beyond exacerbating climate change, fossil fuels have other dangerous environmental impacts, from water contamination stemming from mining to air pollution where they’re burned. ", "A 2019 study in the ", " found that pollution from burning fossil fuels — like particulates, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides — kills 3.6 million people per year. Conversely, reducing air pollution has massive health, economic, and social benefits. Some researchers have found that the ", " more than make up the cost of the transition to clean energy. ", "In addition, carbon dioxide isn’t the only greenhouse gas to worry about. Methane is the dominant component of natural gas, and while it burns cleaner than coal, it’s also a potent heat-trapping gas, about ", ". Any natural gas leaks can quickly undo any climate benefit from the fuel. The IEA found earlier this year that methane emissions from the energy sector are ", ". ", "Another worry is that fossil fuel infrastructure is expensive. It can take years to build up the mines, pipelines, and roadways to support power plants and refineries, and these billion-dollar investments can take decades to pay back, creating a long commitment to continue burning fossil fuels. But the world needs to dramatically cut fossil fuel use in the coming years. While the onus is on wealthy countries to make the biggest, most aggressive reductions, eventually every country will need to taper off. That time could come before these fossil fuel investments are paid off, creating ", ". ", "For exports, this can be a major risk. Global energy markets are fickle, and while there is currently an upswing in demand for fossil fuels, many countries are realizing just how vulnerable they are if they continue to rely on them. The recent increased appetite for coal, oil, and natural gas in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is likely temporary. In fact, the IEA says it will lower overall energy demand and speed up the transition away from fossil fuels.  ", "According to the IEA’s recent ", ", “the lasting gains from the crisis accrue to low-emissions sources, mainly renewables, but also nuclear in some cases, alongside faster progress with efficiency and electrification.” ", "So developing countries looking to sell their fuels abroad may soon have far fewer buyers and remain stuck with the bill. “If you enter into these agreements, you have to understand this is going to be a short term thing,” said ", ", a professor of energy and development policy at University College London. ", "On the other hand, many countries in the Global South have a ", ". Wind and solar power are already the ", " in much of the world, and they can get up and running faster than just about anything else. They are particularly beneficial for some of the most remote communities, where it’s difficult to build out the roads and power lines needed to support large, central power stations. ", "There’s also no guarantee that using more fossil fuels will yield their promised benefits. Plenty of developing countries already have massive fossil fuel reserves, after all. “My question really always goes back to, why hasn’t this happened already?” Mulugetta said.", "In fact, there are plenty of examples of the opposite happening, the so-called ", ", where a country’s valuable natural resources fail to deliver economic gains. Nigeria, for example, has been producing oil since the 1950s, but it didn’t see much economic growth until the 2000s. Now the country is now facing a contraction, as ", ". Corruption and ", " has prevented most ordinary Nigerians from seeing larger gains in their standards of living.

", "The costs, however, have become impossible to ignore. Nigeria has ", ", contaminating farmland and fishing waters for millions of people. ", "So while fossil fuels do have immense potential, the price may be too dear, and in many cases, there are alternatives. ", "Halting climate change at all implies that human-caused carbon dioxide emissions have to stop, which in turn means that there is a finite amount of carbon dioxide humanity has left to emit, what’s described as a ", ". Most advocates, researchers, and governments do agree, at least in principle, that the poorest countries deserve the most of what’s left. ", "“If we have any kind of carbon budget remaining, then it should of course be first and foremost usable by those countries,” said Trotter. “Is this a gift worth having? The answer to that is we don’t know.”", "In a paper published in the journal ", " in October, Trotter, Mulugetta, and their colleagues examined African countries and their paths forward on energy. They found that there was no consistent pattern relating fuels, economics, and energy access. The variation between countries was too great, and there is a dearth of empirical evidence. ", "The authors concluded that there are no categorical recommendations, and that each country’s ladder out of poverty and into prosperity will look different. Figuring that out will require more research on the ground informed and led by people in those countries. For some, it will indeed make sense to use more coal, oil, and natural gas. ", "The other big factor, of course, is money. “Every discussion about energy is a discussion about finance,” Mulugetta said.", "Whether they fund renewables or fossil fuels, wealthier countries have a moral obligation to help poorer countries improve their welfare, and on a far larger scale than they are now. This includes the ongoing damages from climate change as well as the transition toward cleaner energy. ", "There have been some recent advances on this front. At COP27, negotiators took a long-awaited step to address the ongoing destruction from rising sea levels and weather events reaching greater extremes, creating a mechanism to ", " incurred by the less wealthy countries. ", "Wealthy countries have also reached direct deals to speed up the shift to clean energy. The US and the European Union launched the ", " last year to get South Africa off of dirty fuels. This year, a similar deal was ", ". ", "While they aim to “mobilize” and “leverage” billions of dollars to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, these agreements are vague on whether that will come from governments or private companies and whether it will take the form of loans or grants. ", "“Yes, this is a phenomenal good step, but what is key is for real money to be put at the table,” Lopes said. “Everybody has become tempted by the ‘leveraging’ business, which is a nice cop-out.” ", "At the same time, global emissions are rising, and wealthy countries still have to make drastic cuts to their contributions to the problem. The good news is that ", " have already managed to grow their economies while cutting carbon dioxide pollution. Many more are on course to sever the connection between pollution and economic growth, but it will take more investment and policies to speed it up further. And time is running out. Carbon dioxide can linger in the atmosphere for more than a century, so humanity today is forging the climate decades into the future. If there is any hope of keeping warming in check, the actions have to start now. "]},

Pet sitting can be a perfect option for single travelers, who are often financially punished for traveling alone. They have to pay for single occupancy. They don’t split the Uber.

After two years of quarantine, I wanted some freaking adventure. After a decade living in one of the nation’s most expensive cities, I wanted some spending money. Yes, I lived in strangers’ houses. I also majorly upped my payments to my credit cards, to about what I’d been paying in rent. And instead of paying my electric bill, I took cooking classes. Instead of shelling out for wifi, I ate blue corn piñon pancakes at cafes and bought artisan earrings and scarves in the little shops in Old Town. I lived a little. All that was totally worth whatever weirdness I might have felt about being in someone’s shower.

", " from 2021 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released in September shows upticks in cases of gonorrhea and chlamydia — but outpacing them is a disease that the US at one point nearly succeeded in eliminating: syphilis.", "Syphilis is a sometimes-fatal infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacterium that leads to skin rashes in its early stages and, in its later stages, complications ranging from neurologic problems to cardiovascular disease. About a quarter of people with a syphilis infection who don’t get treated have serious complications — including death in around ", " of cases.", "Most concerning is the data on who is getting infected with syphilis: Case rates in women and babies ", " between 2017 and 2021 — a much larger increase than the rise among men, and larger still than the uptick in other sexually transmitted infections. In that time range, the number of syphilis cases in women rose from two per 100,000 people to seven per 100,000, and the number of infants born with congenital syphilis — not including those who died before birth — increased from 24 to 74 per 100,000.", "The abrupt rise of the infection in women and babies ought to sound an alarm. When a baby has syphilis, it’s usually because it was infected while in the womb; about ", " of pregnancies in people with syphilis result in the death of the fetus or newborn. In the US, prenatal care involves syphilis testing, so delivering a baby while having untreated syphilis signals that the mother faced a barrier to getting prenatal care. When many people are delivering babies with congenital syphilis, it’s a sign that America’s health care system is failing women on a larger scale — especially women of color, who according to the data have the highest rates of infection.  ", "To understand syphilis’s explosive rise — and why experts are worried about containing it — it’s helpful to understand the infection itself, the risks it poses, and the gaps in the US health care system that are allowing it to surge. ", "It’s worth saying upfront that the early stages of syphilis are pretty easy to treat. A single shot of penicillin does the trick — and for people allergic to penicillin, two weeks of the cheap and widely available antibiotic doxycycline also works very well to clear the infection. ", "But if a syphilis infection isn’t interrupted by treatment, the disease usually progresses in ", ". The first begins with a single, painless bump that generally shows up a few weeks after infection. This bump is usually located where the bacteria that causes the infection first entered the body — usually in or around the mouth, genitals, or anus, but occasionally on other skin sites like the hands. ", "After three to six weeks, the bump goes away on its own, and within another few weeks, a more widespread rash shows up, often on the palms and the soles of the feet. This second stage can also include other symptoms that look a lot like the flu; fever, swollen lymph nodes, and sore throat aren’t uncommon. But whatever symptoms the person has, they also go away on their own, even if they don’t get treated.", "Over the course of these first two stages and for about a year afterward, a person living with syphilis is contagious. Usually, the infection spreads through contact with a sore during sex, although it can also spread through kissing if a person has an oral sore. Pregnant people with syphilis infections can pass the infection on to their babies while they are in the womb.", "Once the second stage is over,", "the infection goes into hiding in what experts call the “latent stage” of infection. This period, during which people have no signs of infection, can last for years or even decades. ", "In some people, latent syphilis infection might never cause another problem for them. But in others, it can reappear in a third stage of infection. At this point, it can affect multiple organ systems, causing a range of problems so diverse that the infection has earned the moniker “the Great Pretender”: It can cause brain disease that looks like ", ", nerve disease that looks like ", ", eye disease that looks like ", ", and a variety of other problems.", "Syphilis’s squirreliness means some people never realize they’re infected at all. “They don’t even know if it’s a problem because it doesn’t hurt, burn, or itch,” said Irene Stafford, an OB-GYN and syphilis researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. ", "In a recent review of records from 8.2 million blood donations in the UK, 316 donors tested positive for a past or current syphilis infection, and ", " of them were unaware of their infection. ", "It’s not just people with syphilis who often overlook infections: Health care providers ", " with some regularity. According to a CDC spokesperson, among all the cases of syphilis in newborns the agency counted in 2021, 8 percent were born to mothers whose infections were undiagnosed despite getting timely maternal care. ", "That’s in part because ", " providers ", " about patients’ sexual history, but it’s also because syphilis testing itself is notoriously ", ". The best available tests only show whether a patient has ", " had syphilis by measuring their level of antibodies against the bacteria. A provider might make a syphilis diagnosis in one visit if they find a characteristic rash during an exam — but otherwise, they have to repeat the test weeks to months later to determine whether the antibody level is rising or falling.", "That means that even if a provider orders the right test and understands the result, they likely cannot make a diagnosis or treat the infection if a patient doesn’t come back for at least one more visit. This results in many missed opportunities for catching and treating infections — and many more opportunities for onward transmission of the disease. And it’s why routine health care, particularly during pregnancy, is so critical. ", "Health care guidelines recommend syphilis screening tests for people at high risk for either getting infected with syphilis or having severe consequences from an infection — including people with HIV infection and pregnant people, for whom testing is ", ". ", "In the year 2000, syphilis rates among Americans were at an ", ", with 80 percent of the nation’s counties entirely syphilis-free. The disease largely affected men who had sex with men. The rates had dropped so low because of “massive behavior change due to the AIDS epidemic,” said Jeffrey Klausner, an infectious disease doctor specializing in HIV and STIs at the University of Southern California’s medical school. Many men in these communities responded to HIV’s devastation with widespread increases in condom use and decreases in numbers of sexual partners and group sex. That helped bring syphilis numbers down.  ", "In absolute numbers, the majority of syphilis infections continue to occur among men who have sex with men. And while their infection rates have risen steadily since 2000, that uptick has been sluggish compared with the meteoric increases among women and babies.", "Why are case numbers back up now? And why is syphilis affecting so many women? It’s likely due to the convergence of a few trends: ", "“Those things come together and create the perfect conditions for rapid rises in sexually transmitted infections, and then spill over into populations like young women of reproductive age through their male partners,” said Klausner.", "At the same time, the health care system is in a weaker position than ever to respond to the rising tide of infections, he said. State and local public health departments have few resources for testing and following up in pregnant women, and ", " ", " — except those who specialize in men’s sexual health — are often unaware of syphilis’s resurgence and don’t know how to diagnose or treat it.", "The two trends above are made worse by a third: Prenatal care, which can catch infections, is becoming ", " nationwide. Hospitals with birth centers have been closing at an astonishing rate, obstetricians have been leaving rural communities for urban centers, and in 2020, ", " of American women were uninsured.", "As the below ", " map of US maternity care access in 2020 shows, these trends have disproportionately affected the South and the Plains states, leaving 7 million women of childbearing age with limited access to care (counties in yellow and orange, defined as having fewer than two birth centers and fewer than 60 OB-GYNs for every 100,000 births) or in an outright maternity care desert (counties in red, defined as having no birth centers or OB-GYNs). ", "It’s in these ", " that syphilis has begun to claw its way back. The system intended to catch syphilis in pregnancy is failing, largely because the women at highest risk for infection aren’t getting prenatal care. ", "Although the epidemic has spread to nearly every state in the US, rates are highest across the South and in the West. Just eyeballing CDC data (compare the map below with the map above), you can see there’s a lot of overlap between regions that in 2020 had the highest rates of congenital syphilis and those with the least access to prenatal care. ", "It’s also easy to see how syphilis is impacting certain racial and ethnic groups more than others.", "In the last five years, congenital syphilis rates have increased precipitously among babies born to Native American, Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, and Black Americans, due largely to a combination of rural health care strain and systemic racism, said Robert McDonald, a medical epidemiologist who works on syphilis prevention efforts at the CDC. ", "Sometimes pregnant people don’t get the care they need because the clinic is too far away — but other times, it’s because they’re afraid to. ", "For example, people with addiction disorders may ", " out of the legitimate fear they could be arrested for using drugs while pregnant, said McDonald.", "Addiction disorders also increase the risk of getting infected with syphilis to begin with: According to a 2019 ", ", an increasing proportion of heterosexual syphilis transmission is associated with drug use, especially methamphetamine and heroin use.", "In different parts of the country, the reasons pregnant women with syphilis don’t get prenatal care may be different, said McDonald. Substance use may be a particularly important barrier in rural areas and in Western states, while geographic distance from health care plays a larger role in the South, he said. In one of her ", ", Stafford found pregnant women nationwide were more likely to fall out of syphilis care if they engaged in transactional sex or substance use, were experiencing homelessness, or had undiagnosed or untreated psychiatric illness. ", "So while improving funding for sexual health clinics and maternal care would help, it’s not enough to just make the care these places offer more geographically available across the board. The care also needs to be tailored to the specific reasons mothers aren’t seeking care, and must be bolstered with wraparound services aimed at reducing the health impacts of addiction disorders, homelessness, trafficking, and mental illness. ", "That’s a tall order in a country that can’t even agree that everyone has a right to basic health care services to begin with.", "Covid-19 likely exacerbated the syphilis crisis because it required state and local public health officials to reassign most of their sexual health staff to pandemic-related roles, said Finley. It also led to abbreviated hours at many STI clinics, and resulted in many appointments taking place as telehealth visits — during which it’s more complicated to order the kind of lab work that would catch a syphilis case early. “We know that the pandemic played a role just because that failsafe failed,” she said.", "So what can be done to rein in this alarming surge in STI cases? ", "A 2017 ", " suggested that in the sexual networks of men who have sex with men, using a single dose of doxycycline as post-exposure prophylaxis — sort of like a “morning after” pill — reduced syphilis cases by 73 percent. The CDC ", " broadly recommending the practice, in part because it’s not yet clear what its impact could be on antibiotic-resistant “superbugs.” Still, sexual health experts think the strategy has enormous potential for reducing syphilis transmission in key communities, provided patients can overcome its side effects, which include gastrointestinal upset (i.e., bellyaches) and sun sensitivity.", "“I do not think it’s a silver bullet — I do think it’s another tool in the toolkit,” said Philip Chan, a Brown University infectious disease doctor who directs the largest sexual health clinic in Rhode Island. ", "However, studies of so-called “doxy-PEP” haven’t yet included heterosexual women, and doxycycline isn’t safe for use during pregnancy. That means it will be some time before it has an impact on syphilis rates in women and infants.", "Improving funding for STI clinics would also make a big difference, said Finley, who imagines federal dollars dedicated to sexual health care in the same way they are for ", " and ", ". “The federal government has widely recognized and invested in clinical services as a part of their prevention and public health strategies, and we haven’t seen the same thing happen with STDs,” she said.

", "There’s nothing inherent about the Amazon that makes it a good place to raise cows, though it’s an easy way to make money, said Amintas Brandão Jr., a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Wisconsin Madison. Often, farmers or companies will first cut down high-value trees and sell them as timber and then clear the remaining vegetation with fire. Then, they bring cattle in and sell the property, or raise the cows for slaughter.", "This pathway of deforestation has existed for decades, but in 2009, Greenpeace published a ", " exposing how ranching was eating up the Amazon. It seemed like a turning point. Following the exposé, some of the world’s largest meatpacking companies including JBS, Marfrig, and Minerva signed legally binding agreements with authorities — and a separate voluntary agreement with Greenpeace — that prohibited them from buying cattle in land with recent deforestation. ", "On the surface, those agreements appear to be working: Most major meatpackers and slaughterhouses — which influence the entire beef supply chain — screen the cattle they buy for deforestation. Ranchers that sell to them, known as direct suppliers, provide the location of their farms. And the meatpacking companies hire consultants to check those locations for any recent forest loss, using data collected by satellites. ", "But this screening process misses a lot — perhaps even the majority of deforestation in the beef supply chain — undermining the integrity of their zero-deforestation pledges. ", "So, according to decade-old agreements, major meatpackers in Brazil can only buy clean cattle: cows that come from land without any recent deforestation. The problem is, there are several ways to make cattle look clean, even when they’re not.", "The most common way is pretty simple and takes advantage of the complex beef supply chain. A single cow could travel through as many as 10 farms before it’s ultimately killed; it might be born on one, reared on another, and fattened on a third, all before reaching a slaughterhouse. ", "Deforestation could happen in any of those steps, yet slaughterhouses only tend to assess their direct suppliers, the last stop on the cow’s journey. That means ranchers can illegally cut down a swath of Amazon forest to raise cattle and, as long as those animals are transferred to a farm without deforestation before slaughter, they’ll appear clean and the meatpackers will appear to be honoring their commitments.

Investigations ", " that some farmers appear to have edited the boundaries of their ranch — which are recorded in a government database — so that they appear free of any destruction.

JBS and Marfrig both said in a statement to Vox that they have zero tolerance for illegal deforestation and immediately stop sourcing from any farms that violate their policies. (JBS provided Vox with a more in-depth response to the OCCRP investigation, which you can find ", ".) ", "For the OCCRP report, investigators relied on public data showing the movement of cattle between ranches. Farmers in Brazil are required to record the location of their properties and the movement of cattle, albeit in separate government databases. Several years ago, researchers at the University of Wisconsin Madison (who are not affiliated with the OCCRP investigation) figured out how to connect those two pieces of information to untangle supply chains. Since then, their method has been used by scientists and groups like the OCCRP to expose deforestation at various stages of the beef supply chain. ", "Cattle laundering is not only driving deforestation in the Amazon forest but also within its formally protected areas — public lands set aside explicitly for the conservation of natural resources and, in many cases, Indigenous people. (Some protected areas permit the sustainable use of resources.) ", "Between 2013 and 2018, meatpackers slaughtered 60.5 million cattle in the Amazon states of Mato Grosso, Pará, and Rondônia. More than 3 million of them, or roughly 5 percent, were likely at least partially raised in protected areas, according to ", " published this week in the journal ", " More than half of the ranches that produced those cattle had recent deforestation, per the study, which also relied on public data.", "Critically, of those cattle raised in protected land, 2.2 million of them traveled through ranches ", "protected areas before reaching slaughterhouses, which could, again, indicate laundering. (In some rare cases, ranchers can raise cattle legally in protected areas. It’s also hard to declare, definitively, that a ranch laundered its cattle, as it implies an intent to defraud slaughterhouses or the government.) ", "For the most part, it’s illegal for those slaughterhouses to purchase cattle from protected areas, especially if there’s any deforestation on those lands. Remarkably, many slaughterhouses also appear to have bought cattle directly from ranches in protected areas, which their standard screening processes, inadequate as they are, should flag.", "What’s even more alarming is that these numbers are likely underestimates, according to Holly Gibbs, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and one of the study’s authors. Again, this research is based on publicly available information provided by ranchers, meaning they’re registering the location of illegal farms in government databases. “There’s a whole bunch of other properties that we’re not seeing,” Gibbs said, suggesting that not all ranchers are documenting their illegal activity.", "At Vox’s request, Brandão, a researcher in Gibbs’s lab, shared other data (that was not included in the study above) that hints at cattle laundering on a large scale. Between June 2020 and January 2022, for example, 350 properties registered by ranchers in the state of Pará sold cattle, yet they had no visible pasture, according to satellite imagery. This could indicate that ranchers are doctoring paperwork to make it seem like cattle are coming from a different farm — presumably, one that hasn’t chopped down forest. ", "Other data Brandão shared indicates that many “dirty” and “clean” farms are owned by the same person. Gibbs suspects that in some cases these ranchers could be laundering cows through their own properties. “It’s really easy for them to keep that one property clean while they continue deforestation on the other properties,” Gibbs said. ", "One key takeaway from Gibbs’s research is that the majority of deforestation in the beef supply chain occurs before cows reach their last stop on their journey, and therefore, slaughterhouses have a hard time seeing it. “Meatpackers are currently missing about 60 percent of the deforestation within their supply chains by not considering indirect suppliers,” Gibbs said. “They’re really missing what’s going on.” ", "It’s hard to overstate the consequences of cutting down the Amazon in the name of beef. Deforestation not only puts wildlife at risk — the Amazon is home to the ", " assemblage of plants and animals on the planet — but it also fuels climate change. ", "Burning trees produces greenhouse gas emissions, while, at the same time, undermines the forest’s ability to suck up carbon. That pushes the forest toward a dangerous tipping point, whereby parts of the Amazon could dry out, causing more forest to die without any fire or chainsaws. Meanwhile, grazing cattle ", " methane, a ", ". ", "More worrying still is that a lot of beef consumed around the world might actually come from cattle that replaced Amazon forest.

", "The US, for one, is ", ", and the meatpacking giant JBS is its biggest supplier, according to a ", " by the Washington Post. JBS’s brands have sold meat to a number of large American grocery chains, including Kroger and the company that owns Safeway, Jewel-Osco, and Vons, the report revealed. (Several reports have implicated JBS in deforestation, including the Post story and a ", ". You can read the company’s full statement to Vox ", ".) ", "Major meatpacking companies including JBS and Marfrig also have a long history of supplying beef to fast food chains like McDonald’s and Burger King, ", " the research and journalism organization Repórter Brasil. ", "For consumers, it’s not easy to trace the origin of the beef they buy. But they shouldn’t have to, said Moye of Global Witness. “The ultimate responsibility lies on the actors in the supply chain and the governments that regulate them,” he said. ", "Which leads us to a very big question: How are those actors, including the big meatpacking plants, still getting away with this? ", "If small teams of outside researchers can pinpoint the source of forest loss along supply chains, it seems as though giant corporations should be able to as well. Remember, it has been more than 10 years since they committed to source clean cattle. ", "While some experts fault meatpackers for not doing more, rooting out forest loss among indirect suppliers is actually quite challenging. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin, who first figured out how to do this, spent years developing computer programs to download records stored in clunky government systems. They then have to clean them up, link key bits of data together, and run the analysis. ", "These records are not designed to make cattle supply chains traceable, they just happen to serve that function if you know what you’re doing. “It requires a lot of computational expertise,” Brandão said. It’s not like meatpacking companies are just ignoring deforestation right in front of their eyes. ", "The Brazilian government has also made accessing data for these analyses harder in recent years. In 2019, when right-wing president ", " came into power, the government restricted public access to ranch and cattle records throughout much of the Amazon. These documents needed for the analysis are now locked away on government websites. ", "Meanwhile, there isn’t a huge incentive for meatpacking companies to solve this problem in the first place, some experts say. If they choose not to buy from any ranches linked to deforestation, they’ll have a much smaller supply, Moye said. ", "“There’s so much deforestation and problems in the indirect suppliers that if they were to effectively monitor them, the volumes of cattle they receive would dramatically diminish,” Moye said. “They wouldn’t be able to slaughter the volumes they need.”", "JBS disputed this claim. It’s in the meatpacker’s best interest, the company said, to have a transparent, sustainable supply chain, in part because it helps maintain the market for Brazilian beef. Inaccessible government data is “not beneficial to JBS or to the sector as a whole,” the company added. ", "Marfrig also disagreed with the notion that there’s value in obscuring transactions in the beef supply chain, reiterating its “non-negotiable commitment to the total traceability of its supply chain.” ", "Yes, things look bleak. Amazon deforestation is still rampant in the beef supply chain, and there are roadblocks to getting companies to root it out. So what now?", "Consumers have some power; they can swap out beef for plant-based alternatives. Obviously, not all beef comes from the Amazon rainforest or is linked to deforestation, but it has a ", ". ", "But the more immediate solutions lie in the hands of meat companies, starting with untangling their own supply chains. ", "Researchers and environmental advocates are trying to help. A few years ago, Gibbs’s lab at the University of Wisconsin and the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) released software called ", ", which is designed to help meatpackers monitor their indirect suppliers. Using the same source of government data as the research mentioned in this story, Visipec is essentially an add-on to existing corporate monitoring systems. ", "“It doesn’t provide a perfect picture of everything that’s happening — it’s still possible to launder,” Gibbs said. “But it goes a long way toward closing some of those loopholes and creating more pressure for the whole sector.” ", "Visipec runs into the same issues around data accessibility, as any tool would, but it’s a big step above what most companies currently do. Plus, those companies have a lot of power in Brazil and could push the government to make cattle data more accessible, experts say.", "Marfrig and Minerva, another large meatpacker in Brazil, have started using Visipec, the companies confirmed to Vox. Some large companies including JBS also use other systems to monitor indirect suppliers, but they’re typically based on voluntary information provided by the farms that sell directly to them. (Marfrig also has its own voluntary monitoring system, in addition to Visipec.)", "For several years now, NWF has also been working with meat companies to establish “", "” for monitoring indirect suppliers. The idea is to make this level of monitoring feasible for companies while also eliminating more than 90 percent of the deforestation in their supply chains, according to Nathalie Walker, senior director of tropical forest and agriculture at NWF. ", "There’s also legislation working its way through the ", " and the ", " that would prohibit companies from importing agricultural products, including beef, that are linked to deforestation. These bills won’t necessarily provide the tools to increase transparency, but rather a greater incentive to do so. “If these regulations come into force, they can support and incentivize monitoring and traceability of indirect suppliers,” Walker said. ", "Ultimately, to put an end to cattle laundering, meat companies would need to monitor the movement of individual cows, Gibbs said. “If we wanted to end laundering, we would need animal-level traceability,” Gibbs said. “Until we keep track of the individual animals, some level of laundering will keep happening.” "]},

We continue to cooperate on the things we agree on.", "How much leverage does the US have in talks about oil with Saudi Arabia?", "We have more leverage than we used to because we produce a lot more oil. It used to be somewhat true that we relied on them. The world market relies on them for oil, but the fact that the United States is the world’s largest oil producer — and an oil exporter — now makes us a different kind of player. It changes the relationship; it makes the US more powerful, not less. ", "But then you have folks in Congress saying, “Why are we even talking to them when we’re the world’s largest oil producer? Biden, if you ‘drill, baby, drill,’ you wouldn’t have to talk to them.” No, that would never be true. Oil is a global market. But we occupy a very different place in that global market than we used to. ", "And instead of these higher oil prices all going into our foreign expenditures, we’re keeping some of them now. The dollars recycle in our economy, not theirs. High gasoline prices are incredibly unpopular politically, but they’re a lot easier for the US economy than they used to be because we get to keep some of the money."]},

Inactive landfills are supposed to be capped, or covered with soil so that no pollutants can escape, but regulations for landfill capping vary by municipality and state.

Together, inactive landfills, mines, and industrial sites make up a category of land the EPA calls “brownfields.” Cleaning up those sites and ", " turns them into “brightfields.”", "Popkin thinks landfill solar is especially exciting, in part because it’s one of the rare forms of reuse for a landfill that’s actually quite safe: The solar panels can be built on top of concrete stands, called ballasts, that distribute their weight like snowshoes and keep the cap intact. And because landfills are often controlled and owned by municipalities, local communities can have more of a say in how they’re reused — a stark contrast to the often undemocratic processes by which those landfills ended up in those communities to begin with.

Together, those landfills could generate 63.2 gigawatts of power, or 83.3 terawatt-hours of energy each year. And that’s just the beginning; there are over 10,000 closed and inactive landfills in the country, many of which they were unable to study.

While landfill solar on its own can’t correct for systemic problems, “it can be part of a broader revitalization strategy.” ", "In Sunnyside, for instance, the landfill solar project is being paired with a jobs program. Residents from surrounding communities will be able to enroll in a 10-week solar installation training program and use those skills to help clear the landfill and build the new solar farm on the site. Afterward, Jernigan said, some of those residents will have the opportunity to stay on to maintain the solar farm; those who don’t will be well-suited to finding jobs in Texas’s ", ", and the training program will continue to run every quarter.

To allay local fears of the project breaking the landfill’s cap and causing ", ", environmental sensors will be placed around the perimeter of the solar farm to monitor for any leaks. ", "But with the prospect of revitalization comes the specter of gentrification. Popkin hopes landfill solar can buck that trend, in part because little else can be done with the land — in other words, revitalizing the landfill won’t mean there’s suddenly new space for high-rise apartments or organic grocery stores. Instead, the hope is that the economic benefits of the solar project, like jobs training and lower energy costs through community solar, will stay within the community, while also providing an intangible boost to residents’ day-to-day lives by replacing the eyesore of a landfill with something the community can take ownership of. ", "“It was usually people who were disadvantaged who didn’t have a say in what went in their backyard,” Popkin said. Landfill solar can change that paradigm. “It brings attention to a site that has been underutilized or abandoned. That has intrinsic value. Communities can say ‘Hey, people care about us again.’” ", " landfill solar is an easy, low-maintenance solution that comes with some tangible benefits.

The town receives credits for the electricity sent to the grid from the landfill solar farm and puts those credits toward the energy used by its water and sewage treatment plants, which in turn leads to lower water and sewage bills for taxpayers. What was once dead space is now a productive, if small, source of clean energy. ", "But landfill solar projects don’t come easy or cheap. As waste settles inside a landfill, the ground above it shifts, which could make siting a solar project difficult, and developers have to be careful not to place their solar infrastructure where it might interfere with existing structures, like monitoring and gas collection systems. Because landfill capping regulations vary across the country, a landfill may need a new cap before a solar project can even be discussed. ", "Before the ", ", generating the potential 63.2 gigawatts of power from solar panels on former landfills might have been a bit of a pipe dream. Landfill solar requires going through a different permitting process than a solar development on a site without any prior contamination does — and that process stretches timelines into the space of years before construction can even begin. Additionally, building the concrete ballasts for the solar panels to sit on adds to the cost of the project. ", "But the IRA includes ", " in funding and ", " for both brownfields and clean energy projects in low-income communities, which the act calls “energy communities.” Solar projects in low-income communities, for example, come with a 10 percent tax credit for developers, and over half of the IRA’s funding is prioritized for investments in disadvantaged communities. Put the funding and tax breaks together, says Popkin, and the act could spur landfill solar development across the country in an unprecedented way. ", "“Suddenly, you have a national incentive to build these projects,” Popkin said. “And these incentives can be stacked.” That gives local communities and developers alike a reason to pay new attention to abandoned landfills: Community members can look to landfill solar as a way to revitalize the space, and developers stand to reap significant financial rewards for partnering with those communities. If a landfill is improperly capped or emitting pollution of some sort, landfill solar could be a good way to fix those problems and transform the space into something new.  ", "“We’re turning the negative of this landfill into a positive,” Jernigan said. “I hope our successes can be replicated across communities of color to bring about good. It should make the community a place of sunshine.” "]},

Several initiatives, now set in motion by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, will expand the lithium mining industry in the US. Two of those potential sites are in places like Nevada’s ", ", an open pit mine, and ", ", where there are large underwater deposits. Despite the rush of speculation in domestic lithium mining, any serious industry in the US is years, if not decades, from becoming reality. To date, there’s only ", " in the US.", "The other place to look for lithium, cobalt, and nickel, though, isn’t in fresh mines, but in the batteries that already exist. And the good news is the US will soon have recycling plants capable of extracting materials from used lithium-ion batteries. At least five ", " are focused on this effort, including Li-Cycle, Redwood Materials, and Ascend Elements. Federal funding is helping kickstart the industry, too, including ", " that’s earmarked for encouraging battery recycling programs in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.", "The promise of recycling means that the US won’t be so reliant on imports from politically unstable regions or rival countries. What recycling would do, Spangenberger said, is cut dependence on foreign markets so manufacturers only have to rely on them once, for the original mined materials. ", "America’s auto industry is on a quest to make lithium-ion battery recycling something that’s both efficient and cost-effective. ", "So far, the US has a poor track record of recycling the lithium-ion batteries in consumer electronics. Some estimates show as little ", " of those batteries end up recycled, most ending up in the trash, stored indefinitely, or exported as waste instead. ", "Recycling these batteries is still a complex, costly process: the collection and transportation of spent batteries make up nearly half of the cost of recycling — which is an obstacle UC Davis professor Alissa Kendall, who sat on California’s advisory council on EV battery recycling, expects to become ", " around 2025, when tens of thousands of EV batteries will start to reach the end of their lifespan. ", "That means the true test of whether recycling will be profitable and efficient enough to divert batteries from the trash is still a few years off. Until then, facilities like Li-Cycle’s are mostly taking manufacturing scrap. This scrap is usually excess or defective material created during battery construction. Transporting the scrap is simpler and more centralized than what it will look like when car batteries start to pour in from all over the country over the next decade. ", "Another challenge is the way lithium-ion batteries are classified in most states: They are usually considered hazardous waste because they present a fire risk when improperly dismantled, meaning there are more strenuous packaging and capacity standards for shipping them across the country. With few plants open in the US, the Department of Energy ", " a lithium-ion battery has to travel some 50 miles for dismantling, and then another 1,000 miles to a factory for processing.", "Calculating the exact toll of all these added costs is a complicated affair. The DOE’s Argonne National Laboratory developed an economic model that clearly shows US recycling is far more expensive per hour than in China — $50 in the US, compared to $7.50 ", ". ", "Those higher recycling costs explain why mining was the cheaper way for auto manufacturers to procure the materials they needed — until rising demand and pandemic disruptions over the past few years raised the cost of mining. ", "It’s also worth noting that recycling materials uses ", " and generates less pollution than mining. But it’s not a given that the economics of recycling batteries work out. ", "One model for success could be the traditional lead-acid battery that combustion-engine cars use. These batteries pose their own damaging environmental and public health threats, but are also the best-recycled product in the US — with reuse rates ", ". Part of the reason for the efficiency is there are federal and state requirements on how to dispose of a lead-acid battery. Another reason is that consumers already pay for the costs of recycling; it’s just built into the price of buying the battery (these costs vary by state, but since lead-acid battery technology has been around for nearly a century, the added cost runs ", " per sale).", "“We’re accustomed to our vehicles being worth enough that some automotive recycler will take it off our hands,” said Kendall. Lithium-ion batteries aren’t as highly sought after — yet. “There are many conditions where if you don’t intervene with policy, the pure market economics aren’t there. The answer isn’t that we shouldn’t recycle, but that we need policy support to make sure that it’s happening.”", "What happens if we don’t get this waste stream figured out? We’ve seen what happens in other industries, like when the US has tried to recycle products like plastic bags or phones. Consumer electronics have abysmal rates of recycling, and new plastic is so cheap that there is no real demand for ", ". If EV battery recycling efforts don’t institute a better model, they may not work out. ", "“If we want to see [recycling] happen, then we need to expect to pay for it,” Kendall said.", "Let’s assume the economics ", "work out in favor of collecting spent batteries and repurposing them in some way. That could take a few forms.", "One is to simply reuse old batteries for another purpose without fully dismantling them. Even at the end of an EV battery’s useful life cycle, it still retains a lot of its juice. Automakers consider battery health under 70 percent capacity not up to standards for powering a vehicle (and ", " under warranty), but a battery with 70 percent capacity can still work well to store solar power for an electric grid. There are already some ", " to repurpose these batteries for stationary sources in other countries, like Nissan’s partnership with a Japanese utility and Renault’s partnership with European energy companies. ", "However, the vast majority of lithium-ion batteries are still shipped off to facilities that shred them into black mass. What happens to that black mass is where it gets more confusing.", "Most of the US recycling facilities in existence today just generate the black mass to ship to other countries, where the full recycling is finished using one of two techniques. ", "Pyrometallurgy, which uses heat to break down the material but loses a lot of the lithium in the process, was the typical approach until recently. It was cheaper to get new lithium from mines than to work on recovering it in recycling.", "But as lithium prices have risen, newer companies in this space are all focused on hydrometallurgy. This process uses chemical reactions to separate and purify the black mass and retains more of these materials. Hydrometallurgy is considered less environmentally destructive and", "energy-intensive, because it burns less material and uses less energy.", "Bringing down the cost of recycling, and truly keeping these materials within the US, entails scaling up the capacity of domestic facilities that can process the black mass. The ", "’s report on recycling capacities in North America and Europe shows how this industry has been growing. Before 2015, there was just one", "Canadian", "recycling facility for lithium-ion batteries, which in 2015 expanded to Ohio. Now there are 25 in North America and Europe operating or in the works to open. ", "Redwoods Material, associated with Tesla, claims to be the first company to fully remake the battery by processing the black mass, and then reconstructing new batteries. Battery Resourcers of Worcester, Massachusetts, built the largest plant yet in the US, ", " 30,000 metric tons of lithium-ion batteries a year. Li-Cycle will outpace it in 2023 in Rochester, New York, when it opens its first plant to use hydrometallurgy, which it claims will be able to process ", " — or enough for 225,000 electric vehicles.", "There will be even more facilities within the US, all using the hydrometallurgy approach to recover as much lithium as possible, now that there are federal incentives on the table, too. ", "In other words, the industry is poised for a lot of growth. It’s a chance to not just think about how to get a lithium-ion recycling industry up and running, but to ensure it works well. ", "Yan Wang, a recycling expert at Worcester Polytechnic Institute who advises Battery Resourcers, suggested that thinking about recycling from the start of an EV’s life would make recycling easier. Better labeling and more standardization of the exact materials of the battery, which all have different chemistries, would help. “People are developing all kinds of batteries for safety and energy density; the inputs are getting more and more complex,” he said. “It also makes recycling harder.” ", "Another technique for recycling may be just around the corner. It is called direct cathode recycling, an approach under development at ", ", a partnership between industry and the Department of Energy to advance battery recycling technology. Instead of turning the cathode into a kind of soup of elements like hydrometallurgy or pyrometallurgy does, direct recycling keeps the molecular structure intact so the cathode doesn’t have to be completely reformulated again. ", "Spangenberger, head of the ReCell program, said direct recycling may not work in every case for every car, but he hopes it becomes successful enough to work at a larger scale. He explained the goal isn’t to make a cathode as good as new, like hydrometallurgy might, but to get it close enough so there’s virtually no difference in performance. It could be the most efficient process, and one way of moving batteries out of the “hazardous waste” category. ", "The biggest revolution in EV recycling, though, will be when everyone, from the consumer to the auto manufacturer and regulators, begins to consider the end of life of these batteries from their very formulation. ", "There’s still a chance to get this right and get the necessary infrastructure and policies in place, added Kendall. ", "“In the coming 10 years or so we’re going to see a huge number of batteries coming out of vehicles,” she said. “We haven’t missed our window.”"]},

How can we create products that actually bridge that gap and make meat eaters want to eat it?”", "At the same time, he agrees that creating affordable 100 percent cultivated meat isn’t doable — at least not any time soon. SCiFi Foods even conducted its own analysis in 2020 that reached a similar conclusion to one of the analyses in the Counter article.

But at least today, you have to do a blended approach.”", "SCiFi and the few other hybrid meat startups all rally around the same big idea: Take the best attributes of plant-based meat — cheap ingredients, easy to produce at a large scale, consumer familiarity — and marry them with just enough animal meat cells to push their product over the top.

", "David Humbird, a chemical engineer who spent two years conducting an ", " on the feasibility of producing cultivated meat at scale for the foundation Open Philanthropy — and who served as a primary source for Fassler’s article in the Counter — identified cleanliness as a major challenge. Startups will need to ensure their giant batches of animal cells aren’t contaminated with bacteria that would ruin production. They’ll also need to figure out how to make cells grow faster and develop more affordable sources of feed for the cells. ", "Even if everything goes right, Humbird estimated that growing the modest amount of 100 kilotons per year, about the same amount of plant-based meat produced in 2020, would cost $17 to $23 per pound to produce. That’s around four times the cost of cheap ground beef, and double the cost of the more high-end, organic variety. ", "A much more optimistic ", ", conducted by the environmental research firm CE Delft for the alternative protein advocacy group the Good Food Institute, concluded it", "could be possible to bring down the cost of production today (ranging from $10,170 to $68 per pound) to $53 or under $3 per pound by 2030 (since there are so many factors, estimates vary wildly). Humbird and other experts are deeply skeptical of startups ever reaching such a low price point.", "And building out all the infrastructure required for an abundant cultivated meat supply poses another obstacle. Using data from the CE Delft report, the industry publication Food Navigator ", " that producing just 10 percent of the global meat supply through cultivation would require building 4,000 factories costing nearly $2 trillion — around ", " in cultivated meat thus far.

In the coming years, cultivated meat startups will either deliver on their promise, slowly increasing their production while lowering their price, or they’ll burn through their cash and close up shop. ", "But there’s no doubt that the hybrid startups’ approach is the more feasible one at this point, even if it falls short of the utopian origins of the industry. “I read the Counter", "article, and I was like, ‘Yep, this is it. These are all the reasons that we have the approach that we do,’” says Brian Spears of New Age Eats, a startup based in Berkeley, California, that makes hybrid pork products. “I showed [the article] to our investors. I’m like, ‘Look, he’s pointing out the things I’ve been saying for years.’ [We were] tremendously validated.”", "When most cultivated meat companies cook up samples for curious journalists and potential investors, they, too, are often serving up hybrid products. But the distinction between their goods and ones like SCiFi Foods and New Age Eats is a matter of proportion: the hybrid startups are mostly plant-based, while the more “traditional” cultivated companies are mostly cell-based. ", "Eat Just, the San-Francisco-based startup that holds the distinction of being the only startup to have a cultivated meat product for sale (at ", "), told me its chicken is around 75 percent cultivated — much more animal cells than plant. Even at 75 percent cultivated, though, the company told me it’s losing money on each sale. (I tasted it and have to say it tasted identical to the real thing.) ", "Meanwhile, the cultivated proportion of the hybrid prototypes fall somewhere between 20 percent on the upper end, down to the single digits of New Age Eats’ sausage. That gap, the company’s CEO Spears says, could be the determining factor in getting cultivated meat to the masses, even if it’s in small doses as just a few percent of the end product.", "A product that’s 5 percent cultivated is going to cost a lot less to produce than the startups making 75 to 100 percent cultivated meat. “If we’re using low-single-digit by percentage, then all of a sudden, this crazy pipe dream doesn’t seem so crazy,” Spears says. “Because now you’re like 1/50th of the cost for the cell-based ingredients.” ", "New Age Eats is cultivating both muscle and fat cells, the latter of which could be especially important in making their products taste closer to meat than plants. “If you cook a lot of plant-based meats, then you look at the bottom of the pan, you’re going to see a lot of oil because it all melted out — it wasn’t retained in there,” Spears told me. “So you’re going to have a drier or chewy mouthfeel.”", "This is because oils used in plant-based meat, usually coconut or canola, have lower melting points than animal fat. Fat cells have biological advantages too: They grow faster than muscle cells and can be given cheaper feed. ", "But there is one economic drawback to the approach of cultivating cells — fat or muscle — in the smaller batches hybrid meat companies will require versus those startups going for products that are closer to 100 percent cultivated. Fassler says the hybrid startups are going to miss out on the “economies of scale” they might get by producing cultivated meat at mass levels. “The overall product might be cheaper because it’s plant-based ... [but] now you’re adding another kind of very precious ingredient that is going to be one of the more expensive raw materials in the product.”", "The bet is that the cost of that very precious ingredient — meat grown from animal cells — will pay off in the form of a product good enough to lure in, and hold onto, curious meat eaters more than totally plant-based products have. ", "For cultivated meat options to win, they will need to come down in price, and they will need to win over consumers.", "The first challenge remains price. If cultivated meat — whether hybrid or not — stays a premium item indefinitely, it will fail to solve the meat paradox. The war between conventional meat and alternative upstarts will be fought over budget-conscious shoppers in the supermarket aisle. If regulators require meat companies to treat workers and animals better, or reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, the price of conventional meat might rise, just as rules over pollutants have helped increase the cost of energy from fossil fuels.

March even told me that he was inspired to start the company 15 years ago while reading a sci-fi novel called ", " that mentions", "cultivated meat.", "“We think our task is not to hide the science, but it’s to embrace it and then make it safe,” March told me. “It’s an unavoidable conversation ... especially when you look at younger generations, who are going to be some of the biggest consumers for this.

", "Mussels are bivalves, like clams and oysters, meaning they live inside a hinged shell with two parts, or valves. Perhaps you know mussels because you’ve eaten them before, but those are typically saltwater mussels — which, I’m sorry to say, are far less exciting than their freshwater counterparts.", "The US, and especially the Southeast, is the epicenter of freshwater mussel diversity. “When people think of biodiversity, they usually think of coral reefs and rainforests, but the southeastern United States is the global hot spot for freshwater mussels,” Chris Eads, a mussel expert at North Carolina State University, told Vox. “We have something that nobody else in the world has.”", "Many freshwater mussels are beautiful on the outside; their shells are colored with greens, yellows, and browns, and striped with black. Their insides, however, are spectacular — especially those lures. ", "Unlike marine mussels, most freshwater mussels exploit fish (or in some cases, salamanders) to spread their offspring, and they use lures to draw them in.", "Remarkably, some mussels depend on a specific host fish, and they’ll tailor their lures to them. The primary host of the rainbow mussel, for example, is the rock bass, so it mimics one of its favorite foods: a crayfish, gangly legs and all. Just check out the video below.

It’s really amazing.”", "Mussels have gills, too, which is where they house their larvae, Eads said. When a fish strikes the lure — like in the example above — it can rip those gills open, he said, causing the mussel to “spray the fish with a face full of larvae.”", "Incredibly, some mussels can also produce lures that float outside of their shelled body. For example, the orange-nacre mucket mussel, shown below, emits two masses of babies encased in mucous tubes that float side by side. Connected to the mussel’s shell with a string of mucus, the lure looks just like a minnow and even waves in the water like a real fish.

In the process, the fish would take in water containing the larvae, which would pass over its gills (where the larvae latch on). ", "Equally impressive, some mussels create out-of-body lures disguised as aquatic insects to attract smaller fish. Those worm-like structures in the image below are actually packets of mussel larvae, from a species called Ptychobranchus occidentalis, that look like bug larvae. They even have fake eyes. ", "“It’s just an amazing example of evolution,” said Wendell Haag, a fisheries biologist at the US Forest Service, of these kinds of lures. “It’s mind-boggling to think about.”", "Here’s a closer view of those packets of mussel larvae that impersonate aquatic insects. If you look closely, you can actually see tiny, bead-like mussels inside of them.", "Yet another kind of mussel, known as a fluted kidneyshell, creates lures that mimic the pupa of a blackfly, which small fish like to eat. Here’s what those lures look like. ", "For comparison, here’s a real blackfly pupa. ", "Other mussels take a slightly different approach: They’ll open their shells, and when host fish poke their heads inside, the mussels will clamp down, almost like a venus flytrap. ", "With the fish’s head partway inside, the mussel will release a stream of babies. After a few minutes, once the fish stops struggling to escape, the shell lets go. Take a look.

(For more, check out ", " with images and video by Chris Barnhart, a biologist at Missouri State University.)", "Mussels are essentially little Brita filters. They feed by filtering microscopic organisms and debris out of the water, cleaning streams in the process.

", "A single mussel can clean ", " of water each day, removing harmful algae, bacteria, and even metals. Together, their impact is enormous.

Beyond filtration, they can suck up nitrogen in their tissues and shells, Vaughn said, which is especially important in rivers that bisect farmland where fertilizer is abundant.

", "Water pollution likely plays a role; even though mussels filter out pollution, they can only handle so much before they start breaking down, Rypel said. Plus, mussels are, for the most part, stuck in place, so they can’t simply swim away from a source of pollution like fish can. ", "But the decline still remains something of a mystery, Haag said. It could be due to disease, he said, or the spread of invasive clams called Corbicula fluminea, or both. Ultimately, “we just don’t know,” he told Vox. “It’s really mysterious.”", "Whatever the cause, some scientists and environmental advocates are working to bring these mollusks back. Chris Eads of NC State, for example, is raising mussels in captivity to eventually release back into the wild.

The bill provides states and Indigenous tribes with money for conserving wildlife, ", ". It passed the House in June and is set to pass in the Senate, as soon as this fall. ", "In general, it would also help if people cared more about freshwater mussels, Eads said. They need new branding, and they clearly deserve it. Recall that they don’t have brains or eyes, yet they can fool a wide variety of animals with uncanny disguises. And they provide one of the most essential services, water filtration, for humans. Which is to say: mussels are not dull, but magnificent. We need them, and there are plenty of reasons to love them, even if you don’t eat shellfish."]},

Once equipment like weather stripping and seats are added, the half-built car is carried by the conveyance system to a special area, where the battery is finally installed.

Should she do so, the biggest and most permanent damage would be allowing unchecked deforestation in favor of agriculture and logging.

This shift wouldn’t be accidental, but the result of methodical, well-funded efforts to give anti-climate candidates a real foothold.

They’re very efficient; they can generally release upward of 90 percent of the energy put into them.

That movement uphill raises the water’s potential energy; when the energy is needed, the water is released and sent through a hydroelectric turbine, turning the potential energy back into electricity. ", "Pumped hydro took off in the United States during the 1970s and ’80s when the country saw a boom in nuclear power. Nuclear plants were very good at constantly generating a steady amount of electricity around the clock, Mallapragada said, but there wasn’t an easy way to increase or decrease their output. ", "To be able to respond to fluctuating demand, grid operators built pumped-hydro stations to store the excess energy generated by nuclear power plants during times of low energy use; without pumped hydro, that energy could have gone to waste. (It’s a similar dilemma to the one faced by solar and wind power plants, and recently some pumped-hydro stations have seen their energy sources shift from nuclear energy to renewables.) ", "It’s a time-tested, efficient solution. So building more pumped-hydro plants could work well for the future of clean energy. ", "But pumped hydro isn’t perfect: It requires specific geographies (like mountains,", "but any terrain with an elevation difference would work), and building a pumped-hydro station often requires hollowing out rugged landscapes in order to install the pumps and other infrastructure that move water up to the reservoir. ", "That’s an energy-intensive, resource-hungry process. So while pumped hydro could work in some circumstances, especially when existing facilities are being transitioned to renewable energy, it’s only one part of Mallapragada’s jigsaw puzzle of energy storage solutions. One of those pieces, Mallapragada said, could even be taking the principles behind pumped hydro and applying them outside of mountains. ", "Pumped hydro, at its core, uses the force of gravity to pull water downhill and transform potential energy into electricity. ", "But if there isn’t a mountain in sight to build the plant, engineers can essentially build a mountain of their own. This is called gravity storage: Instead of lifting and dropping water, these “batteries” would lift and lower solid blocks of some heavy material like concrete. ", "The most attention-getting version of this technology comes from a company called ", ". A prototype built in Switzerland involved a ", " that uses renewable energy to pick up 35-ton concrete blocks, slowly building a concrete tower around itself and storing solar and wind power as potential energy. When energy is needed, the process is reversed: The cranes let the blocks drop, unspooling their cables and powering a motor that generates electricity. ", "More recent versions of Energy Vault’s storage solution look a bit more staid — the cranes have been replaced with warehouse-esque buildings full of 30-ton bricks riding elevators, which you can see in the video below — but the underlying concept remains the same, using excess renewable energy to power the mechanisms that lift the blocks and dropping them when renewables aren’t available. ", "The concept isn’t limited to building towers or bricks on elevators. Other companies are exploring using abandoned mine shafts as potential gravity storage sites that can help stabilize the grid during energy spikes. ", "Gravity storage sidesteps the mountain-sized hurdle getting in the way of new pumped-hydro stations, and experts say it should be just as efficient as pumped hydro. Yet it, too, isn’t perfect: Building gravity storage systems is also energy-intensive, and the costs might outweigh the benefits — especially if lithium-ion batteries continue to get cheaper.", "Energy Vault says it’s working to get costs down, particularly in terms of raw materials: the company ", " WIRED’s Matt Reynolds that their new bricks can be made out of waste materials rather than concrete, reducing the energy load of setting up the system. ", "A key problem in the energy transition equation — and currently occupying the minds of the international negotiators at COP27 —  is how to pay for it, especially in countries that installed fossil fuel power plants relatively recently. ", "Unlike the United States, which has an aging fossil fuel power plant fleet that is nearing (or, in some cases, well past) retirement age, countries like India and China are home to coal-power plants that have plenty of shelf life left. ", "That’s where thermal energy storage comes in. In a thermal storage system, renewable electricity coming from sources such as wind turbines or solar panels is used to heat up a material that’s particularly good at capturing heat, like a molten salt, and surrounding it with insulation to essentially make a giant thermos. That heat can then be released to create steam or hot air and drive a turbine, just like a coal or nuclear plant today. ", "Mallapragada’s particularly excited about the potential for thermal storage because it can potentially be used in existing fossil fuel plants by swapping out, say, a coal burner for a thermal storage unit. This solves multiple problems: A large portion of the existing infrastructure can remain in place. Coal plants are already attached to the power grid, which saves on costs, and many of the existing jobs at those power plants will transfer over to a plant powered by stored thermal energy — which means a more equitable energy transition. ", "For developing countries, that could be a game-changer. But — and you might be noticing a theme here — thermal storage has some downsides too. Gravity storage and pumped hydro are very efficient; you can usually recover somewhere in the vicinity of 70 to 85 percent of the energy stored. Thermal storage is much less efficient, so it couldn’t be relied on alone. It’s just another piece slotting into the jigsaw, rather than the complete picture.", "Every solution discussed so far has been something other than a chemical battery. But even if lithium-ion might not be the best solution for the grid, there are still some chemical batteries worth considering. One of them even uses something that, unlike lithium, is ubiquitous: rust. ", "Rust is usually a nuisance. But a type of battery called an iron-air battery turns that idea on its head. ", "Unlike the rest of the solutions in this story, iron-air batteries are the most similar to what we traditionally think of as batteries: they rely on chemical reactions to store and release energy, just like lithium-ion batteries. But traditional batteries are usually a combination of two or more chemicals inside one battery casing. In iron-air batteries, one of the chemicals is iron — one of the most abundant metals on our planet. ", "The other chemical? The oxygen in the air around it. ", "Iron rusts. We all know this. But rusting is a chemical reaction, called oxidation, and just like the reaction in a lithium-ion battery it can be reversed. That is to say, we can charge up rusted iron. ", "It’s as if the electricity is being used to polish the iron: Charging the iron keeps the oxidation at bay, but the iron’s natural state is to ", "to rust. Letting the iron rust essentially pushes the electrons out of the metal, discharging the battery. When it’s time to charge the battery again, the process is reversed. ", "It all sounds a bit sci-fi, but the idea is quickly becoming a reality; a company called ", " recently ", " with a Georgia utility to build an iron-air battery that can store 100 hours’ worth of energy. Eventually, the company hopes to build farms of iron-air batteries, each ", ", that can scale in size according to the needs of a community. ", "Mallapragada cautions though, building rust batteries is “easier said than done.” It’s hard to find the sweet spot of a chemical combination that can charge and discharge without losing too much energy along the way.", "Rusting iron isn’t the most efficient battery in the world — its 40 to 60 percent efficiency range pales in comparison to the ultra-efficient lithium’s 90-plus percent — but it’s much, much cheaper and easier to make. Lithium-ion batteries require all sorts of limited metals; iron is everywhere. ", "Energy storage isn’t going to be simple, and there isn’t going to be any single solution that’s going to get us to a place where we can be free of fossil fuels. Some of the batteries mentioned here might not even work; many are still in early testing. But all of these solutions, put together with many more we didn’t touch on here, are still important steps in the right direction.", "If they’re implemented across the country — mountain batteries in some places, perhaps thermal tanks or warehouses full of rusting iron in others — they would be the key to both stopping and living with climate change and its threats to the power grid. Even as extreme weather gets worse, stored energy could help us quite literally weather the storm. ", "“I’m quite optimistic that we can solve this problem, because we have all these solutions,” said Mallapragada. “The right answer will look very different for California than it would for the Northeast or other parts of the country or even other parts of the world. We have all the pieces. We just have to figure out how to make them work together.” "]},

", "War in Ukraine and Europe’s ban on Russian gas have already reshaped global markets. Europe is feeling the crunch because of how much of its gas came piped from Russia, but the US faces a different kind of problem.", "Throughout ", " of the 2010s, the US had a supply glut that kept the wholesale price of gas low. Supply far outpaced domestic demand, and almost none of it was exported as liquified natural gas (LNG) to other countries. But since 2016, the US has built new terminals that are capable of exporting gas in its more condensed liquid form. Increased exports have raised costs for American consumers as they compete with global markets that fetch better profits for the industry. Add in the costs of inflation and extreme weather disasters like winter storm Uri, and it looks unlikely that prices will come down for quite some time. ", "Now that the US is increasingly at the whims of the global market, the pitfalls of running an economy on gas are becoming more obvious. ", "Until the last few years, the main consumers of gas were industry, the electric sector, and homes, businesses, and vehicles. As LNG exports have grown, they’ve essentially “squeezed” the rest of these US markets, particularly residences, explains Clark Williams-Derry, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).", "Like the gasoline you pay for at the pump, there isn’t a universal price of natural gas. The closest indicator we have for it in the US is called the Henry Hub, a wholesale price named after a busy distribution spot in Louisiana. Looking at what’s happened to the Henry Hub prices helps explain the weirdness of US gas markets right now. ", "The Henry Hub is not what you’re paying. By the time the gas gets to the home, you’re paying for what it takes to distribute the fuel, the pipelines, and the labor involved. Regulated utilities, generally, are charging consumers for the gas they use and then a fixed cost, the cost of building pipelines to deliver the gas. These costs are rising too, thanks to inflation, so ", " are rising even faster than what the Henry Hub would indicate.  ", "The ", " was so low for most of the last decade that producers had trouble staying in business.

The opening coincided with a momentous decision made in 2015 to lift a 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports. To ward off another government funding showdown with the GOP-controlled Congress, President Obama signed into law a spending bill that meant the US could start shipping oil to foreign markets for a better price than they could fetch domestically. ", "It has taken time for the US to ramp up its export capacity, with a pandemic mixed into the equation, so the impact on markets has taken a bit of time to catch up. But economists, including those at the EIA, agree that these terminals are having an impact on domestic prices. ", "An unexpected event this summer demonstrated just how important exports have become to determining the US price of gas. ", "In June, there was an explosion at the second-largest natural gas export plant, Freeport LNG, a facility designed to turn gas into its liquid form so it can be shipped across the ocean. The plant, responsible for ", " of US LNG capacity, has been ", ", reducing export capacity by a few percentage points. ", "Henry Hub prices were skyrocketing at the time of the explosion, but even the dent of 2 percentage points in overall US gas consumption was enough to make an apparent difference. The terminal has faced a series of delays in reopening, but when it does, it will once again shift the domestic supply of gas. Two percentage points might not sound like a lot, but there’s not a lot of wiggle room since the pandemic in oil and gas supply and demand. As the explosion showed, it’s enough to change the wholesale price of gas. Indeed, the EIA expects prices to increase further “when the Freeport LNG terminal in Texas” resumes its partial operations because more gas will be exported. ", "The squeeze will just get tighter if the US continues to build more of these terminals. As they ramp up, LNG exports are projected to ", " from 2020 levels in 2023. Normally, these terminals are subject to years of environmental reviews and permitting, but Republicans and some Democrats have pushed for speeding up those timelines. Some progressive Democrats have pushed for the Biden administration to pull the plug on LNG exports altogether, fearing that it is not only driving higher prices, but locking the world into decades more of fossil fuel usage that it can’t afford. ", "“There isn’t a point in which you build enough infrastructure that somehow you isolate yourself from global markets,” said Lorne Stockman, research director for the climate advocacy group Oil Change International. “There are times when supply catches up with demand and prices come down, but inevitably demand starts catching up with supply again. It’s like a hamster wheel.”", "Henry Hub prices have been falling since August, but residential consumers haven’t felt much relief.

Unprepared for the frigid temperatures, the state’s independent grid saw vast blackouts as gas infrastructure froze and demand for heating spiked. ", "The supply shortages this time resulted from weather, not international conflict, but the effect was the same as war: Prices went skyrocketing. The combination of these things could have hypothetically turned a $200 bill into a $10,000 one. To ward off that catastrophe, utility regulators instead had companies space out the costs from the storm over a longer period — so", "consumers, not just in Texas but in Colorado and Minnesota, could be paying for the storm over the next decade.", "The problem is, winter storm Uri was possibly not a one-time fluke but an event that may grow more likely because of climate change. It’s harder for scientists to link a single frigid weather event to climate change; some research ", " that warming in the Arctic will increase the chances of polar air spilling south.", "There’s a valuable lesson in the Freeport explosion from this summer.

", "Stockman suggests it is time to get off the hamster wheel where we try to drill our way out of high energy prices. “The key thing that will make energy cheaper and more secure for Americans is to reduce and eventually end our use of these commodities,” said Stockman.

Another is the range of consumer tax breaks that incentivize energy efficiency of the home, including energy-efficient appliances like heat pumps. Finally, utilities and consumers alike face new incentives to buy renewables over gas, tipping the economics firmly in solar and wind’s favor. ", "“We’re going to start to see the level of adoption in the next 12 to 24 months that will add up to a pretty big dent in gas demand over the medium term,” Dyson said. “Even a couple of percentage points drop in gas demand from power, buildings, and industry could actually have a pretty big effect on prices.

All those solutions can be costly or challenging. ", "It takes a building-by-building adjustment in each of these categories to achieve healthier buildings while minimizing financial costs and climate impacts.

That means there’s no minimum for building managers to strive for, and no way for inhabitants to know what’s in the air they’re breathing.", "Still, there is guidance telling engineers and architects how to design buildings with air quality in mind.", "The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers — ASHRAE, a professional association whose guidance outlines minimum standards for acceptable indoor air quality — updated its ", " after the pandemic began.", "ASHRAE’s standards include minimum ventilation rates that a building’s HVAC system should have, and measures that should be taken to prevent contaminants from entering inhabitants’ air supply. But it doesn’t include a requirement to check whether any of those controls are working. ", "Broadly speaking, there’s still no standard for assessing indoor air quality as a whole — only individual measurements quantifying its components. Effective sensors to detect carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter are available on the retail market, but there’s no widely approved composite score that communicates indoor air quality the way the ", " does for outdoor air quality. No simple parameter captures the safety of a building’s air in a way that’s meaningful to the public; no unambiguous reporting metric exists to facilitate accountability. ", "Without this, building owners have little incentive to improve bad air, said Cull. ", "He imagines something akin to the health department score many restaurants have to post up front: “The restaurant owner doesn’t want to have that sign, but it’s a requirement to post that they got a B minus for hygiene and cleanliness,” he said. Perhaps building operators should be doing the same for the air they offer inside.  ", "Besides the lack of meaningful standards or regulation, the upfront cost of improving indoor air quality is one of the biggest obstacles to achieving it.", "At a minimum, gold-standard building designs involve electric utilities rather than gas, and an HVAC system powered to drive a full fresh air exchange of the building’s air four to six times an hour. They also clean the air using high-efficiency filters. Achieving that standard is an expensive project, usually in the range of several million dollars for a high-occupancy building.", "Building operators with large budgets and a lot of motivation can and do spend that kind of money to make the changes they need to make.

In a recent ", ", Hannah Carter, who manages school air quality projects at the US Green Building Council, said these schools often lack adequate facilities staff to keep up with needed changes, and may be less likely to get guidance on improving their air quality from federal sources. “It’s definitely an equity issue,” she said.", "Public schools’ facility budgets are usually fixed, and except in the richest districts, relatively modest, making it prohibitively expensive to achieve the gold standard. And while federal grants like those available through the ", " are meant to make premium upgrades attainable, they don’t always work the way they’re supposed to.", "Consider the case of the Milford School District in southern New Hampshire. Buildings and grounds director Bill Cooper knew that one of the highest-impact changes he could make would be to replace the five aging HVAC units that served the high school. ", "When Cooper heard federal dollars were available for school districts to make improvements aimed at mitigating Covid-19 transmission, he jumped at the opportunity to get funding. But he quickly found there were enormous obstacles to clear: He had to get a detailed set of plans approved by the state fire marshal’s office, which required bringing in an engineer to make each unit’s drawings and plans to an exhaustive level of detail. “That’s a lot of work,” said Cooper.

", "Although the price tag may prevent many building operators from making initial investments in permanent and effective air quality solutions, Joseph Allen, an environmental health expert who founded the Healthy Buildings program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, argues that the payoffs outweigh these investments by several orders of magnitude. In a 2015 ", " modeling costs and benefits of doubling office buildings’ ventilation rates, Allen and his co-authors found businesses had a lot to gain from relatively small investments in workers’ air quality.

While investments in a building’s engineering can lead to a higher resale or rental value — gains that do end up in the owner’s pockets — that profit can take a long time to be realized, and most building operators want to see a return on their investment in three to five years, said Cooper, the school facilities director.", "Many of the interventions that lead to cleaner indoor air consume additional energy — often, a lot of additional energy. And in the US, coal still supplies about ", " of the nation’s electricity. It’s not ideal to create more outdoor air pollution in pursuit of cleaner indoor air.  ", "Fortunately, it’s entirely possible to have healthy buildings that use very little energy, Singer, the environmental scientist, said. When it comes to indoor air quality, climate and health priorities “are absolutely compatible, but attention needs to be paid to both in order to accomplish that,” he said.", "Among the clean air building strategies that reduce climate impacts are HVAC tune-ups to improve energy efficiency, and novel technologies like energy recovery ventilation, which uses the warmth or chill of exhausted stale air to heat or cool fresh air being brought into a system. ", "Older strategies — perhaps the oldest ones — also work: opening windows is an incredibly cheap, effective, and climate-neutral way of increasing ventilation.  ", "But these strategies only help if they’re used. Anand, the sustainable building engineer, said because windows that don’t open and close are cheaper than those that do, many high-occupancy buildings have inoperable windows.", "That trend highlights one of the biggest barriers to industry-wide change: culture. Although plenty of strategies exist to overcome cost and climate concerns in the service of healthier indoor air, getting decision-makers to choose to construct and run buildings differently means asking many people to realign their priorities, with the impediments often clearer than the incentives. ", "When Tom White, who works for an affordable housing nonprofit in the Bay Area, switched one apartment building’s utilities from gas to electric, he encountered resistance from all sides. White said the choice rankled both the workers putting in the new electric conduits and the pipefitters who lost out on work setting up the building for gas. “It’s like, ‘Why would we want to change when we have all of this energy just sitting in the pipe right there?” he said.", "If a change like this is so challenging to make even in California, with its climate-forward political culture and many green building incentives, how much harder is it to make in states where fossil fuels run the table?", "The pandemic has made Americans perhaps more aware than ever of the links between clean indoor air and their health. ", "But what they still lack is leverage. Even after a global pandemic made filtration and ventilation household words; even after the business case for healthier buildings was made clear in ", " and the ", "; even with mountains of data on one side, there is little regulatory recourse people can use to back up their demands for better indoor air. ", "We shouldn’t need carrots and sticks to make our workplaces, schools, residences, nursing homes, and places of worship safe, and to engineer them to better protect us from common pollutants or the next pandemic. Our health should be enough of an incentive. But for indoor air quality to become a business priority in the US, we’re going to need something with more teeth. ", "People need a clear path for demanding better when buildings fail them. They deserve transparent standards for indoor air, with metrics they can easily understand and use to make their own decisions. And they require policymakers to provide enough support — and consequences — for building owners to ensure they meet those standards.", "“The cost of fixing that HVAC system to work properly, to provide good ventilation and filtration,” said Singer, is not the critical barrier. “The key barrier is not the cost. The barrier is the knowledge, the infrastructure, the culture.”"]},

And even if some researcher ", " do that for some reason, the statistical analyses in this paper wouldn’t detect it — they only make sense if you assume a different virus-synthesis strategy.

To counter that, sunlight really is the best disinfectant.

Researchers gave initial impressions, read the paper, and refined their initial impressions. Some of them developed their own quick tests of the robustness of the statistical conclusions. People tweeted graphs, arguments, counterarguments, and yes, the occasional insult. We all got to see how the sausage got made, and honestly, it wasn’t that gross.

In the ages before preprint servers, all this anger and all the insults — but also all of this genuine truth-seeking and intellectual curiosity — would have happened behind closed doors. I’m not very sorry it now happens in the open instead — though I do think journalists have a lot of work to do to make sure that the truth can catch up with rumors. "]},

", "The first time scientists tried to develop an RSV vaccine, in the 1960s, it failed miserably, actually leading to more severe RSV infections in the babies who received it.", "Although that tragedy slowed vaccine development somewhat, it didn’t entirely dissuade researchers. But over the next few decades, ", ", largely due to some unique features of RSV’s surface proteins.", "Those proteins are shape shifters, taking different forms depending on whether they’ve invaded — or fused to — a human cell. And to complicate matters, their pre-fusion shape is wildly unstable. That meant that for a long time, researchers’ only option was to use the protein’s post-fusion shapes as targets for new vaccines.", "As a result, for years, RSV vaccines could only recognize viral particles after", "they’d invaded cells — too late to make much of a difference. To make a better vaccine, scientists really needed a clear picture of what those surface proteins looked like ", "cell invasion. ", "In 2013, structural biologist Jason McLellan, now at the University of Texas at Austin, figured out how to get that picture: ", ", then described it in great detail. That discovery meant researchers could now create vaccines that targeted an earlier stage of RSV infection. And they did, with incredible results. ", "In her conference talk, Chu presented data on five different vaccines for use in adults and six products for use in younger populations, including vaccines for pregnant people and both monoclonal antibodies and vaccines for babies and young children. ", "What she then described would have seemed inconceivable a few years ago. ", "Chu presented data from phase 3 trials — advanced vaccine studies that test a product’s safety and effectiveness. Overall, these products are knocking it out of the park, preventing more severe RSV cases at a range of 70 to 86 percent effectiveness. Writ large, that means they have enormous potential to prevent hospitalization in many of the people most vulnerable to the worst effects of RSV.", "Of the many options currently under development to protect babies from severe RSV infection, the one that will likely get the most use is a vaccine that would be given not to babies themselves, but to the people who carry them before they’re born, said Edwards.  ", "When someone is immunized against RSV during pregnancy, the antibodies they produce in response get transferred in large quantities to their infant, providing a strong wall of protection over the first few months of their lives. “Maternal vaccination — I mean, that’s the ultimate monoclonal antibody,” said Edwards,", "and “a lot of moms are used to it.” ", ", which relies on antibodies transferring naturally from pregnant people to fetuses while they’re in the womb, is used to protect babies from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (with the maternal Tdap vaccine), the flu, and SARS-CoV-2.", "In particular, Pfizer’s RSV vaccine candidate for pregnant people prevented 85 percent of RSV cases in their babies from getting bad enough to require bringing them to a clinic or hospital. ", "But even if the expecting parent does not get vaccinated, there will still be options to protect their babies: Several monoclonal antibody options will likely be on the table, which prevent between 70 and 75 percent of more severe symptoms. In contrast to the maternal vaccine, these are intended to be given directly to infants after birth. Importantly, both the maternal vaccine and the monoclonal antibody will be available to protect all infants, whether they have medical conditions or not. ", "Even with the vaccines and antibodies, there will still be some challenges. The protection babies get from maternal vaccination or monoclonal antibodies lasts less than a year. However, some children — like those with medical conditions such as heart abnormalities — need longer-lasting protection. (Most children are at highest risk for bad RSV in their first six months of life, and should be well covered by maternal vaccines and antibodies.)", "The strategy for refreshing their immunity is still up in the air, said Chu. It might involve getting repeat doses of monoclonal antibody — or it might eventually involve giving a vaccine to a young child directly. Two candidates for that are currently in the early stages of investigation and so will not be widely available for several years. It will be up to the FDA and the CDC to determine how best to keep infants protected in their early years.", "Meanwhile, three vaccines for adults are in ", " ", " ", ", and at least two more candidates are at earlier stages of development. The three closest to the finish line prevent 80 to 86 percent of severe RSV infections in people over 60. ", "In the US, all that stands between these vaccines and the people who need them is finishing the trials (for those still in progress), submitting data for review to federal agencies, and approval and recommendation by the FDA and the CDC.", "Chu suspects these vaccines’ benefits will take many Americans by surprise. “I don’t think that the general public is either aware of RSV or realizes what a huge change this will be,” she said. She also underscores just how important the basic science underlying some of these vaccines has been. McLellan’s protein stabilization discovery also helped facilitate the development of Covid-19 vaccines by providing a technique for stabilizing SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein. “It is a momentous achievement that they were able to do that — and that’s how things moved so quickly,” she said, referring to the lightning pace of production of the first Covid-19 vaccines.", "The discovery’s original purpose — to enable RSV vaccine development — will also do enormous good.", "“I’m very excited, and for a variety of reasons,” said Edwards. “One: babies shouldn’t die,” she said. But also, as these products become available, she said, “most of us believe that we’re going to see a reduction in hospitalization — and that can only work in our favor.”", "If only we had these vaccines and antibodies available this year. RSV is currently surging, and hospitals hollowed out by the pandemic are struggling to meet the need. Many hospitals increase their staffing at this time of year, said Edwards, but that’s becoming harder to do because of shortages across the medical professions. ", "“Granted, this season has been worse than most,” she said. “We don’t necessarily anticipate having this bad season every year.”", "“But as staffing shortages become more and more acute around the country, we would expect even smaller and smaller surges to incapacitate hospitals,” she said.

The challenging aspects of grief can be exacerbated with each new loss, according to Litsa Williams, a licensed social worker and co-author of ", ", which can lead to fatigue and overwhelm. There is “the emotional piece, but also the other stressors —  coping with the practicalities of settling an estate, sorting through belongings, family conflicts, financial strains,” she says via email. It can be hard to face a new loss when you feel like you’re starting at “half capacity.” ", "Sometimes after multiple losses, support systems are less engaged than they previously were, Williams adds. An additional loss can make a person feel like they need more support at a time when their support system is weaker than it previously was. “Support system burnout is also a real factor. With the first loss or first couple of losses, a person may have received a lot of support from friends and family. But unfortunately, with multiple losses stacking up, support systems can start to become less engaged,” she says.", "While the term “cumulative grief” often refers to deaths that occur in rapid succession, says Cara Mearns-Thompson, the co-founder of the ", " and a licensed clinical social worker focused on grieving children, that time frame isn’t an essential component. The term is most often applied to losses in a short amount of time, but losses over any period of time can result in cumulative grief. ", "The close succession of losses can increase feelings of overwhelm, but the timing is less relevant because grief is a lifelong journey. “Cumulative grief is cumulative over a lifetime because we grieve for our entire lives.

", "Secondary and tertiary losses can also result from a single incident. For example, “think of the death of a person as the first circle, and the outer rings would be the secondary losses,” says Mearns-Thompson. If an individual’s parent died, for example, Robinson says that would be a primary loss. The potential secondary loss could be financial instability due to the loss of parental income. ", "These secondary losses can contribute to a feeling that “everything” has changed. It can be an overwhelming, disorienting experience that can also be invisible to others — which can cause an even larger sense of isolation in the griever.

", "It’s not uncommon that a new loss brings up old memories from a prior loss, according to Mearns-Thompson, but those feelings may surprise you. Many people believe that grief won’t have a long-term effect. “We believe that the work of grief just takes time. As time goes on, the impact will be less, but that’s not true,” says Robinson.", "Grief is a lifelong journey. “We don’t grieve a death and then lock it up in titanium, never to be gone back to again. We go with our assumption and our belief that grief is non-finite —  is something that we take with us for the rest of our lives, that it becomes part of who we are. And every new loss or death that we experience is going to overlap and interweave with our previous losses, and there are lots of different ways that that can show up,” says DeCristofaro.   ", "Some grief therapists, like Mearns-Thompson and Robinson, take an inventory of a client’s prior losses during counseling. This is called a “loss history,” and the practice of recording it enables both the client and counselor to better understand the person’s prior experiences with grief, their coping styles, and to explore any new tools that they may need to manage their current experience.", "There is no expiration date on grief. “A loss that happened five years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, even 40 years ago, can continue to affect us throughout the course of our lives, but can also affect the way that we come to future losses,” says Joanne Cacciatore, ", " and founder of the ", ", an organization that provides support to families struggling with traumatic grief.", "If you’re feeling overwhelmed by your grief, take the time and space you need to take care of yourself. “Treat it like a psychological wound that deserves care and attention,” says Robinson.

Taking care of your physical body through nutrition, sleep, and movement, making time to journal or join a support group, and trying out remembrance activities like sorting through pictures or sharing stories are just some ways to help yourself work through your feelings, says DeCristofaro. ", "A counselor or therapist can also be an important part of the healing process. While support and community are extremely important when dealing with cumulative losses, sometimes you’ll find that your support system isn’t showing up for you or is stretched thin. Still, you should try to find independent and community-based ways to heal, and seek support through a counselor or therapist.", "On a daily basis, exercise and sleep have helped me the most. And longer-term, speaking with a therapist, writing about my experience, and opening up more to my closest friends have also made it more manageable. With time, I’ve also learned to show myself more compassion when my grief arises, which has helped. ", "Multiple experiences of loss can be destabilizing and can lead to internal judgment, according to DeCristofaro. “Each time we experience a new loss, we experience ourselves grieving in a new way, and that can lead to judgment or criticism about how we have or haven’t grieved in the past, or what does it mean about the person and what they meant to us in our lives if we are responding really differently,” says DeCristofaro. ", "Sometimes we don’t grieve someone the way we anticipate, which can be confusing. If you lost someone as a teenager and then lose someone later as an adult, those grief experiences likely won’t be the same. As an adult, you’ve had years to mature and it’s easy to reflect on your younger self grieving with nostalgia, or at times criticism, says DeCristofaro. You may feel hit harder emotionally by the death of someone you had a complicated relationship with, or feel that you should grieve “more” for a current loss, says DeCrisotfaro. ", "These reactions are normal, and the more we understand that we can grieve each loss differently, the more we can give ourselves permission to do just that. ", "You need to be compassionate with yourself, your grief, and how you’re feeling, says Robinson. “We often discount what our experiences are and tell ourselves that we shouldn’t feel that way. There is a lot of feedback that we receive about what we should do that often impacts our ability to just feel and grieve.”", "Remember that there isn’t one way to grieve. You’re going to feel your grief in your own way and time, says DeCristofaro. “It is probably not going to fall on the same timeline as other people.”", "Our reactions will be impacted by a variety of factors, such as how supported we feel by the people in our life, the relationship we had with the person we lost, and the context of what is going on in our life and in the world, according to DeCristofaro. ", "Whatever your reaction, it is important to allow yourself to feel the emotions that arise. “It’s when we’re shut down and we pretend that it didn’t happen and we suppress and inhibit our own emotional experiences, and the emotional experiences associated with traumatic loss, that we suffer — in my experience — even more,” says Cacciatore.  ", "In instances of multiple loss, be aware of whether your grief and life stressors exceed your capacity to cope, says Williams. Williams prefers the term “grief overload” over cumulative grief or bereavement overload, which are often used interchangeably, because she believes that this is the central issue for multiple losses.  ", " “‘Cumulative grief’ as a term suggests that the issue is simply the number of losses that is the challenge. In reality, the real issue is the overload that occurs when someone’s stressors exceed their coping capacity, and when, why, and how that happens varies dramatically from griever to griever,” she says. ", "Multiple losses can be devastating. In the early period of grieving, it’s hard to see past that period of intense sadness. But prior experiences of loss can also serve “as a way to draw on hope and healing and a belief in a positive future,” says Mearns-Thompson. ", "We need to remind “people that they have survived and they have made it through” grief before, says DeCristofaro. “They know more than they think they do about how they navigate grief and what they value, and that they can use those skills in facing the same loss.”", "The losses that I have experienced devastated me, and I can’t change that. But those experiences have also become a source of pride for the obstacles I have faced and learned to live with (and still do today). If you experience grief overload, don’t be afraid to ask for help or reach out for support. It can be hard to do, but you’ll never regret giving yourself the care you deserve when facing a difficult time. "]},

Instead of leading to greater appreciation of our best weapons against infectious disease, it is possible, even likely, that the hesitation and fatigue generated by Covid vaccines may spill over into vaccines for other diseases.

Prior to the pandemic, ", " were already opting out of some recommended vaccines while consenting to others and often designing vaccine schedules of their own for their children, Jennifer Reich, a University of Colorado, Denver sociologist who studies vaccine hesitancy, told me. That’s in part because Americans tend to view vaccines in the same way they do consumer products, like a dietary supplement or over-the-counter drug — meaning they believe it’s up to them to decide whether to use or not, based on their perception of its risks and benefits, rather than relying on expert or government recommendations.", "This “personal management of health” model, described in Reich’s 2016 book, ", ", explains why so many people feel they are better equipped than experts to make choices about vaccines for themselves and their children.

That’s not new, but “the pandemic just sort of exacerbated problems that were already in existence,” said Reich.", "During the pandemic, Americans essentially had a “crash course” on vaccines, as Waleed Javaid, director of infection prevention and control at Mount Sinai Downtown in New York City, put it. This had mixed effects. On one hand, Americans gained a greater understanding of how vaccines work and where they come from, just as they did with viruses and variants. On the other hand, many struggled to grasp the complexities of a medical intervention that, after all, requires putting something in your body to prevent a disease, not cure one already present. “If you understand a little but not a lot or all of it, then you run the risk of misunderstanding several factors,” which could lead to hesitancy, Javaid said. ", "As Americans paid more attention to vaccines, many naturally had more questions, but finding the right answers was often difficult, while finding the wrong one was often all too easy. The timing of the vaccine rollout, eligibility requirements, and dosing schedule — mostly multiple shots spaced weeks apart, with boosters to follow — were fairly complex to begin with.

The breakthrough cases that followed eroded support for the shots, even as the lower hospitalization rates and avoided deaths that could be attributed to the vaccines were overlooked. Since it was never made clear that vaccine-generated immunity was always expected to fade, booster campaigns were set up to fail. These drawbacks, together with more pernicious misinformation and disinformation, led to confusion, frustration, mistrust, and, in a significant part of the population, rejection. ", "That rejection inevitably became politicized, though not at first. Operation Warp Speed, the government project that led the development of the Covid-19 vaccines in record time, was completed under then-President Donald Trump, who was ", ". But as the vaccines were released under President Joe Biden and increasingly mandated by employers and the government, some Republican leaders ", " on existing ", " among their constituents by ", " insinuating that the vaccines ", ", while arguing that mandates ", ". Vaccination hesitancy, or wariness of the policies mandating vaccines, became a separate issue from the vaccines themselves, said the Rockefeller Foundation’s Gellin.", "Messaging against vaccines and mandates resonated with Republican voters.

", "Any spillover of hesitancy into these diseases may eventually appear in their vaccination rates, but there isn’t enough information yet to know for certain, experts told me. “Part of the problem is that we don’t have good metrics” for vaccine hesitancy, said Gellin. A useful, albeit flawed, indicator for vaccine hesitancy among parents is the CDC data on childhood vaccine exemptions, though it includes many other reasons why families opt out of vaccines, such as inaccessibility and inconvenience. The proportion of American children with exemptions in the most recent school year — 2.2 percent, which the CDC ", " — does not differ significantly from last year’s data. ", "Interpreting future data on recent vaccination rates will be complicated by the fact that routine vaccinations declined during the pandemic in part because of school closures, lockdowns, and overwhelmed health care systems, which made it harder for parents to access vaccines and weakened the force of school mandates. In the 2021-22 school year, the CDC recorded a drop in childhood vaccination coverage of 1 percent compared to the previous year.

", "Even if the numbers haven’t yet caught up, plenty of anecdotal evidence points toward an acceleration of existing vaccine hesitancy during the pandemic. Georges C. Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, told me that “we’re definitely seeing some effects,” such as parents refusing to give a child multiple vaccines on a single visit, though he noted that such concerns also existed pre-Covid. ", "More parents are saying they aren’t necessarily mistrustful of the vaccines but of the experts touting them, Rupali Limaye, an associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University who studies vaccine acceptance, told me. Parents continue to express the sentiment that diseases such as Covid, chickenpox, or the flu are “not that bad” and don’t warrant getting a vaccine, Hackell added. ", "One key area to watch for evidence of spreading vaccine hesitancy will be uptake of the flu vaccine, which is one of the few vaccines that, like Covid-19, is recommended for nearly everyone other than newborns. So far, surveys about flu vaccine intentions do not suggest any significant changes.

Public health officials are urging people to get their flu shots, but they are working against vaccine fatigue, Javaid said. “It’s almost like an ‘I give up’ kind of situation.” On the flip side, people “who became supportive of Covid vaccines may now be seeking out flu vaccines even if it wasn’t a priority in the past,” said Reich. “It may work in the other direction.”", "Recent polling suggests politically motivated vaccine hesitancy has already spilled over from Covid-19 into the flu vaccine. In October, Grid News found that ", " had gotten the flu shot so far this year. This polarization of flu vaccine attitudes had already existed before the pandemic, but since then, the gap between Democrats and Republicans has grown even wider.

Patricia Ruppert, the health commissioner for Rockland County, told me that the continued low childhood vaccination rates in her jurisdiction can largely be attributed to worsening vaccine hesitancy engendered by a pandemic-related uptick in vaccine safety concerns, political polarization, and low access to the vaccines.", "​​Now, several bills opposing children’s vaccine requirements being considered in state legislatures could lead to further decreases in vaccination coverage. Hackell is doubtful they will succeed because only a “small minority” of people support them, but he acknowledges that such demands are new territory. “You would not have heard that five years ago,” he said. ", "Daniel Salmon, a vaccinologist who studies vaccine decision-making at Johns Hopkins University, told me, “My strong suspicion is that we’re going to see really big drops in vaccine coverage across the board.” And when that happens, outbreaks may occur in a predictable pattern, based on the global prevalence of the virus: Measles, which is common, will be the first to reemerge — Salmon calls it “the canary in the coal mine” — likely followed by pertussis. “It’s a really scary prospect,” he said.", "Dismantling childhood vaccine requirements would not only lead to more illness and death but likely worsen inequities in vaccine access, too. Childhood requirements, introduced in earnest in the 1960s and implemented through the 1980s, aimed to make vaccines more accessible to low-income children, who tended to have lower immunization rates than wealthier ones. The federal ", ", launched in 1977, put millions of dollars in funding behind efforts to increase childhood vaccination rates and establish a system to administer vaccines. It led to the development of school vaccination requirements in all 50 states.", "But if those policies are dissolved, free vaccines, paid for and offered to states by the federal ", ", will become less accessible to families who rely on them, said Reich. Parents will no longer be able to assume that their children are safe from infectious disease at school. And just as before, those without regular health care access or insurance will be most at risk. It won’t happen in every state, but it certainly can happen, she added, “should vaccines continue to be politicized the way they have been.”", "The politicization of vaccines in America is particularly unsettling because the country is split roughly in half. Vaccination can stop community viral spread only if a population reaches the herd immunity threshold for that virus. “You need 50 percent plus a hair to win, or the Electoral College. In vaccines, that’s a huge loss,” said Salmon. “If we have only 50 percent of people vaccinated, we’re screwed.” ", "Political polarization on vaccines hasn’t always fallen along the same party lines. For a long time, vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccine views were closely associated with a certain kind of Democrat — “crunchy granola purists,” as ", " put it, who were hypervigilant about avoiding toxins and GMOs and tended to live in wealthy white enclaves such as Boulder, Colorado, and Marin County, California. But the pandemic, and the tense political milieu in which it unfolded, triggered a shift in the demographics of vaccine hesitancy.", "In Marin County, once the bastion of the anti-vaccine movement, Covid-19 vaccination rates are now among ", ". Local attitudes to vaccination changed over the pandemic, and “it kind of became the cool thing to do to get vaccinated,” one physician told the ", ". Public health campaigns addressing parents’ fears around vaccination, plus memories of the 2014 measles outbreak at Disneyland, which spread to Marin, swayed local opinion. The association of anti-vaccine views with conservatism also shifted attitudes in the heavily Democratic county. Marin was able to “signal a change in cultural values and norms within their community, and my impression is that a lot of that happened because they were having local conversations” about the reasons behind hesitancy, said Reich.", "All of the experts I spoke to said that improving communication about vaccines is critical for countering hesitancy and skepticism. Complete transparency — in real time — is needed so that people can manage their expectations of what vaccines can do, and just as importantly, what they cannot do. Those led to believe, incorrectly, that vaccination was supposed to protect them from getting Covid and would allow them to stop wearing masks lost confidence in the vaccine when breakthrough cases occurred and masking recommendations persisted. People felt betrayed, said Reich, by the fact that vaccines didn’t make the disease go away, as they did for polio, measles, or smallpox, even though respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, are rarely eliminated through vaccination. (Witness the persistence of influenza year after year, despite the fact that there has been a ", ".) ", "Of course, even the best messages are worthless if they cannot reach their intended audience. Training the health care providers who administer vaccines to communicate with patients is paramount, as they are among the ", ". Another popular strategy is to use “trusted messengers” — respected community members who can range from celebrities to hairstylists — to target communities that are harder to reach. It is one of the main techniques used by PolioPlus, Rotary International’s polio eradication effort, said Carol Pandak, the program’s director.

Shortages for medicines that a patient can pick up at the pharmacy often draw the most headlines, but most of the medications that end up in short supply are generic, injectable drugs that are used in hospitals: usually, these drugs have only one or two suppliers. So if there is a problem at the factory of one company, there is not an easy way to scale up production to make up for a shortfall. And they are usually cheap, which means the companies that manufacture them do not have a strong economic incentive to produce any excess supply.", "“We haven’t invested in expanding the capacity our country needs. It’s costly. If you’re going to sell something for a dollar a vial, there’s no incentive to invest there,” said Erin Fox, a pharmacist at the University of Utah who has studied drug shortages. “It makes a lot of sense when you think about it from their perspective. But when you think about it from the hospital perspective, it’s very frustrating.”", "Some of these shortages have led directly to patient deaths.

But they require action by the federal government. Until that happens, there is little reason to think the pace and duration of America’s drug shortages will slow down.", "Manufacturing a prescription drug is complicated. A company first has to acquire the necessary ingredients, sometimes from suppliers all over the world. The producer must take those raw materials and then manufacture the drug, at a factory capable of executing a technically sophisticated production process, in the most economical fashion, while also meeting FDA safety and quality requirements.", "Take a look at this graphic from the National Academies report.

Ingredients get contaminated. Manufacturers are not required to disclose the reasons for a shortage, but the recent ", " — while it’s not a drug — is illustrative. The FDA required Abbott Nutrition, one of the largest suppliers of baby formula, to shut down its main plant because of unsanitary conditions and contaminated products.", "As with the baby formula shortage, it’s hard for the industry to compensate when production is halted. Most of the drugs that experience shortages are generics, and there are generally only a handful of companies producing a given generic drug. If one of them has production problems, it can mean that suddenly half — or more — of the expected supply is wiped out.", "And once the supply is disrupted, it’s impossible to quickly make up for the shortfall. These companies rely on razor-thin margins and massive scale to make their business work. They have a “just in time” production schedule, which means almost as soon as the product rolls out of the factory, it is delivered to health care providers. There aren’t warehouses with emergency stockpiles, because it wouldn’t really make financial sense for manufacturers to produce and store the excess supply.", "Shortages due to distribution problems or an increase in demand are less common, but they do happen. Fox pointed to ", " as one way that, even if a drug has been produced without problems, there can be a delay in getting it to patients. And in the early weeks of the pandemic, there was a surge in demand for drugs, including albuterol, that created temporary shortages.", "Whatever the reason, shortages can have serious consequences. In 2011, there was a year-long shortage of norepinephrine, a blood pressure drug used for patients experiencing septic shock, because of production problems at three manufacturing sites. Researchers ", " of patients who needed norepinephrine for septic shock at hospitals that were out of the drug, and relied on a substitute, versus those treated at hospitals that still had it in supply. They found that patients at the facilities experiencing a shortage had a higher mortality rate.", "The same applies for patients who need a longer treatment but can’t find the drug that would best serve them. One study ", " that the mortality rates among cancer patients who must use a substitute drug are higher. Replacing drugs can be difficult for clinicians; hospitals experiencing morphine and sedative shortages ", " patients being given the wrong dosage of a substitute drug, leading to serious clinical distress and even deaths.", "But even if the stakes are not life and death, drug shortages can meaningfully change the kind of care patients receive. When I spoke with Turrentine about the Pitocin shortage, he said doctors may not be able to induce labor in a pregnant person without the drug, which increases the possibility of the patient needing a C-section delivery. C-sections are more invasive than vaginal childbirth, with a greater risk of complications and a longer recovery time. It ends up being more burdensome for the patient, and it costs more money to provide the care.", "But the existence of these clinical consequences isn’t enough to force drugmakers to change their process or to start producing an excess supply. They are running a business, and the economics of drug production are driving these shortages. Those are not going to change unless policymakers overhaul the rules. ", "The authors of the National Academies report ", " to address drug shortages, from trade agreements that make it easier to import and export medicines in a shortage to an overhaul of the National Strategic Stockpile, one of the few available reserves for a small number of essential drugs when there is not enough supply.", "There are some other, shorter-term patches included in that list of recommendations that would make it possible to end a shortage sooner. Hospital systems could enter emergency purchasing agreements for certain vital products, to give them another option if their main supplier has a production problem. The government could do more to secure excess supply of some essential medicines as well.", "Under the current system, though, it isn’t practical for the government to purchase excess supply of every possible pharmaceutical, nor does it make economic sense for the drug manufacturer to maintain reserves indefinitely. These solutions are really Band-Aids, deployed once there is already a shortage.", "But how do we stop shortages from happening in the first place?", "I asked Fox, one of the report’s authors, what she would prioritize if she had the opportunity to wave a magic wand and do one thing on drug shortages. Her answer: unlocking other possible solutions starts with more transparency.", "Fox and her co-authors want pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose more information about their production facilities and the ingredients they use to make drugs. That would help government officials identify potential vulnerabilities in the supply chain and better anticipate oncoming shortages if there is a breakdown in supply of those materials. Beyond that, though, they are also urging the FDA to make public its assessments of the safety of drug manufacturing plants and the quality (as in purity) of the medications produced there.", "With that information, Fox envisions the creation of a rating system that would let both providers and patients know much more about where their drugs are coming from. That would allow them to make more informed decisions about which drugs to buy. ", "But higher-quality medicines are more expensive to make and therefore may cost more. So if hospitals are still making economic decisions to prioritize cost over quality, the feds could give them a nudge, Fox said. There could be carrots (such as tax credits for buying drugs from a higher-graded manufacturer) as well as sticks (making the purchase of drugs from a supplier with a certain rating or higher a condition of Medicaid or Medicare funding).", "You could imagine a scenario in which steering purchasers toward certain products could lead to even more dependence on one supplier. But Fox’s response, when I raised that point, was that many products are already facing that situation, given the way the pharmaceutical market is constructed. At least under a system like she described, manufacturers would be rewarded for taking the steps that should make shortages less likely.", "“There’s no profit for companies to invest in quality in manufacturing plants,” she said. A concept like this would be one way to change that. “Target our dollars to companies that are doing a good job.”", "And even if higher-quality drugs mean more expensive drugs, Fox argued that could still be a deal worth making. Drug shortages already drive up costs in subtler ways: Labor costs go up if patients are in the hospital longer and require more intensive care. A substitute drug might need to be bought, another expense. The clinical benefits should be obvious, given what we know about how shortages can negatively affect care.", "Those are changes that won’t happen overnight, and they would require a serious commitment from the government. But Fox hopes the US sees an opportunity, given the way Covid-19 has made everyone more aware of and sensitive to supply chain problems of all kinds. It’s not always been easy to get policymakers to pay attention to drug shortages, she said. “It’s kind of a boring story. If there is a bright point to Covid, it’s shining a light to these supply chain problems.”", "Until officials actually act, there are bound to be more shortages and more headlines like we have seen in the past few weeks.

In the very earliest stages of an outbreak — say, when Covid first began spreading in China in late 2019 — a virus can be stopped with targeted measures.

Why are the protesters resisting the Chinese government’s policies now, and what do they want?", "To explore the underlying grievances expressed in China’s public squares, the role of workers in the nascent movement, and how the government might clamp down in response, I reached out to Eli Friedman, a sociologist at Cornell University. Friedman teaches about how China’s rapid rise as a global economic power has affected the country’s workers, who have been drivers of the demonstrations. He is the author of ", "The protests have not yet reached 1989 levels, according to Friedman. But the uprising presents something that hasn’t happened since Xi took power in 2013.", "“For the first time under Xi Jinping, we have a nationwide protest movement,” he told me, “because nearly all Chinese people, at least Chinese people in large cities, have been subjected to similar kinds of surveillance and controls on their mobility over the past three years, and people are clearly fed up with it.”", "Though China’s government represses its citizens, protests have endured over the years and with some regularity. But they tend to be very local. As Friedman put it, “What’s really unique about what we’re seeing now is that it is nationwide, that it is responding to a policy not just of some corrupt local officials or some bad boss, but quite specifically to a policy of the central government. Even more specifically, to a policy that Xi Jinping himself has taken responsibility for.” ", "Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.", "Going back to October, there’s been a whole series of protests against lockdowns. They first emerged in October when thousands of workers at a Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou, a large provincial capital in central China, were put in what’s called the closed loop management system. They were not allowed to leave the factory. And as the virus began circulating within the factory that has 100,000 [workers], people were concerned for their health. People within the factory were put into quarantine and were not being given adequate medical attention, or in some cases, even adequate food. People were worried about their livelihood and so thousands of workers just escaped, literally just jumped over the fence, because their employer was not letting them out. ", "In November, there’s a series of other events, including some big protests in migrant worker communities in Guangzhou in response to a lockdown — again, they were not allowed to leave their houses, so they’re dependent on the government delivering them everything that they need to live on, and", "were not getting adequate medical attention and were not getting enough food. There were some riots there. Then there were more protests and very intense and violent riots in the third week of November, again at the Zhengzhou Foxconn facility.", "That’s the prelude to the really big explosion, which happened following a fire in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang province. The official death toll in that fire was that 10 people died, and there are credible suggestions that as many as a couple dozen people perished. ", "This really struck a chord nationally, because hundreds of millions of people have had some experience over the past three years being subjected to these lockdowns, and in some cases, literally locked in their apartments and unable to leave. ", "Although the specific information is debated — and the government has not been totally forthcoming — there are reasonable suspicions that some of these people might not have died had they not been under lockdown. After that, we see the whole deluge of protests in every city in the country. So that’s the fuse for these big protests. ", "The reason that the past three years of “zero-Covid” are really important is because we have these seemingly particular events — migrant workers in Guangzhou, factory workers in Zhengzhou, and then this fire in Urumqi. The response from residents resonated nationwide. For the first time under Xi Jinping, we have a nationwide protest movement, because nearly all Chinese people, at least Chinese people in large cities, have been subjected to similar kinds of surveillance and controls on their mobility over the past three years, and people are clearly fed up with it.", "It is unbelievably diverse. We do have people who are in factories, who are migrant workers, who are highly exploited workers producing iPhones and other electronic gadgets that Americans and other people consume. We have other kinds of workers, the ones in Guangzhou, where [there are] very small garment workshops in very dense, informal housing arrangements. We have students at super elite universities — Tsinghua University, which is Xi Jinping’s alma mater. Dozens of universities around the country have had protests.", "Then if you look at the protests in other big coastal cities, like Shanghai or Beijing, you have a mixture — it’s hard to tell just from looking at the crowd, but certainly some pretty well-off white-collar workers.", "The fact that the fire happened in Urumqi is interesting and important. Because Xinjiang is a place where the Uyghur minority, who are Muslims and are a minority nationally, but they represent at least a plurality, if not an absolute majority of the population in Xinjiang. They’ve been subjected to a very intense regime of repression, surveillance, policing, and mass incarceration over the last five years. Most if not all of the people who died in the fire were Uyghurs. If we look at the protests in Urumqi itself, it appears, though it can be hard to tell, that most of the people are Han, from the dominant ethnicity.", "The lockdown is a national policy, a blanket policy, around de-mobilizing people. But the effects have been very, very different.", "What I think is happening is we have opposition to the lockdown as this kind of umbrella. It’s this category that has affected nearly all Chinese people in one way or another. Within that, people are raising all kinds of other demands. The workers at Foxconn were concerned with pay. The people in Xinjiang, to the extent that Uyghurs are able to openly speak, have big concerns about the broader repression of Muslim minorities. You have the students who are holding up the white pieces of paper, and that’s an expression of opposition to censorship and demands for free speech. ", "First, digital censorship in China is comprehensive, but it is not perfect. So even if you’re using the Chinese internet, China-based apps like WeChat or Weibo, they’re not 100 percent perfect. They have well-developed AI that tries to anticipate certain kinds of things that they will scrub. They have teams of tens of thousands of people who are paid censors who are looking through this stuff. But there are still collective-action events that get through or things that are critical of the government that get through, particularly when there is a large quantity of things happening at the same time. ", "The second thing is, particularly for people who are highly educated, it is still possible to use VPNs to get over the Great Firewall. People have access to Twitter and are posting photos, or sending videos or photos to international sites, and then people even within China who can still access those sites. It’s a relatively small percentage of the population.", "But the third thing — which I think is actually most important for understanding these particular mobilizations — is that they’re just doing it the old-fashioned way, where they know people in the community. If you look at this whole sequence, the first event was Foxconn. Well, Foxconn has 200,000 people living in these incredibly tightly packed dormitories. They just were talking to people face to face. The next event in Guangzhou was these informal housing communities where the whole community was locked down, but you could move about within the community and people within that community were all having the same experience of worrying that they didn’t have enough food. So they talked to each other, and they went out and they tore down the fences and fought with the police. ", "Even in some of the bigger cities, certainly in Beijing and Shanghai, you have people who are communicating online about going to specific locations, but you’ve had other smaller-scale protests, where it’s just people within a large housing community. If they have lockdowns in these communities with thousands of people on the inside, they can’t leave, but they can talk to their neighbors.", "In the Chinese context, they are very, very different. There are a lot of protests in China, and there has been, for the last generation, protests among workers, among peasants who are having their land taken, some smaller-scale things among students, among feminist activists. Environmental issues have generated some big protests, as well as ethnic minorities. Tibetans have also had some major protest movements. But almost all of these cases have been very localized, in response to some specific local grievance.", "What’s really unique about what we’re seeing now is that it is nationwide, that it is responding to a policy not just of some corrupt local officials or some bad boss, but quite specifically to a policy of the central government. Even more specifically, to a policy that Xi Jinping himself has taken responsibility for. ", "This is not remotely a 1989 kind of situation yet.", "One of the reasons that people jumped to this — something China scholars talk about is collapse-ology, which is like, every time something goes a little bit wrong for the Communist Party, people assume that it’s on the verge of collapse. That gains traction because the state itself sets such a high bar for what social order looks like. In the United States or other democratic societies, if you have a protest of tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of people in the nation’s capital, that is really just not a big deal for the state. ", "In the lead-up to the 20th Congress, there was this one guy who hung these banners off of a bridge, expressing opposition to zero-Covid policy and calling for the end of Xi Jinping’s rule. That was huge international news. That guy’s slogans are now being chanted all around the world. ", "The government sets a very high standard for what social order looks like, and when there’s a deviation from that, people assume that means that things are completely falling apart, that they’ve lost control. And the truth of the matter is, that’s not the case. This is a real challenge, and we’ll see how they respond in the coming days. But, absent some kind of internal split in the party — and there was as yet no evidence that that is the case — this movement itself can be pretty easily repressed. The state has just overwhelming resources at its capacity. Even if we look at what’s happened in the last 24 hours, there are many fewer protests, many people have already gone to jail. The costs of participation will continue to escalate. ", "All these questions that people are asking, which are legitimate questions, like how come in the last three years the Chinese government — which can mobilize vast resources on a scale that no other country in the world can do in a short period of time — how come they haven’t built more ICU beds to increase the capacity for real outbreaks? They can mandate that people don’t leave their apartments for months on end, but how come we can’t get more people vaccinated? And so there’s a real frustration about that; people understand that the virus doesn’t have to be super deadly, but the government has not been doing the things that would allow them to learn to live with the virus. ", "The wrong answer would be for the government to say, “Okay, tomorrow, there’s no rules, go for it,” because in fact, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of mostly elderly people would die. What they need to do is develop a very clear plan for exiting zero-Covid — timelines for how to vaccinate all these people, to increase health capacity, particularly in underserved communities. And they’re not doing that. And so that leaves many people with a sense that this is just going to be life forever, which leaves people feeling really kind of despondent, especially when they see every other country in the world doing something different. ", "Sometimes Americans are like, “Well, this is interesting that that’s happening over there, but why should we care about this?” ", "Aside from the fact that American companies are implicated in these closed loop management models, I think there’s a broader issue around the question of surveillance. Because in order for zero-Covid to operate, it has required a huge expansion of state surveillance capacities. Now, the movements of people are very closely monitored. There have been times when they’ve locked down entire districts of the city, thousands of people, because there was one positive case. The only way to enforce that is through these apps that are tracking your movement through the city. ", "We don’t have that in the United States, obviously, and I don’t think that there’s a likelihood that the federal government will be able to implement something like that. But I think a lot of Americans and people in other countries outside of China do have concerns about surveillance, either by governments or by corporations. ", "Just in the last few days, you’ve seen videos of police on the streets in Beijing and Shanghai, going around and just asking random people to look at their phones. They go through your phone and see if you have any photos of protests, if you have any banned apps or anything like that, and that can land you in trouble. It is important for us to pay attention and be in solidarity with these protests. "]},

And people are willing to do that even in this very closed state.”", "As Wallace said, that has important implications for global perceptions of China, not so much as to whether the regime is weak or strong, but even in an authoritarian state, not everyone is marching in lockstep with the images — and narrative — that Chinese Communist Party has sought to create."]},

Outside of Wuhan, further outbreaks had been minimal until spring waves this year in Shanghai and Hong Kong that were at that point the largest of the pandemic.

The Chinese health system adds obstacles because it doesn’t use primary care doctors, the physicians who are seeing these patients most often, to get people vaccinated. Patients must instead go to specialized vaccination clinics, which may be more difficult for the elderly to reach.", "And seniors’ low vaccine uptake is also, indirectly, a result of the zero-Covid strategy. China could not readily test its vaccines within its borders because there were not many cases. Clinical trials in the US and Europe relied on the rampant spread of Covid-19 to evaluate their vaccines’ effectiveness. But China didn’t have that opportunity and so it had to outsource those natural experiments, mostly to developing countries.", "The populations in those countries are generally younger, however, so it took longer to collect data for older age groups. That is why China rolled out its vaccine in the opposite way to almost any other country: The vaccine was authorized for younger people first and then later, once the data was in, for seniors. Experts say it created some confusion among that population about whether or not they should actually get vaccinated.“The communication wasn’t that clear,” Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, told me. “People thought, ‘Previously you said I didn’t need to get it.’”", "For elderly people who have not gotten the booster shots, their last shot may have been a year or more ago and, based on ", ", their immunity is likely to have waned substantially. That raises the risk that they will develop serious symptoms, end up in the hospital, and possibly die.", "There are a lot of unknowns about how this reopening might look in reality, which will dictate the extent of any exit wave.

But, according to the experts I spoke to and the reports they have received from people in China, Chinese hospitals are preparing for a significant wave of infections. According to a report Bouey saw over WeChat and shared with me, “the government is planning to open up and anticipating the large increase of hospitalizations.”", "The omicron variant already sparked the kind of major wave in Hong Kong that experts fear in mainland China.

The consequences could be grave for people infected with the coronavirus as well as other people with serious medical needs.", "The country’s health system relies heavily upon hospitals. General practitioners are not as prevalent as they are in the US and European health systems, Chen said. Instead, people will generally go to the hospital for most of their health care needs.

Since 2010, it has built hospital buildings across the country. The problem is there are not enough people to staff them. If there isn’t a doctor on call or a nurse who can tend to patients in between doctors’ visits, the quality of care is going to suffer. Some of the hard-hit areas could live through something similar to what happened in parts of Italy in 2020, Bouey said, when people died because there was no hospital staff to treat them.", "Here is the problem in crude numbers: China has more hospital beds than the United States, 4.3 versus 2.9 per 1,000 people, according to ", " But China also has fewer doctors than the US (", " versus ", " per 1,000 people) and significantly fewer nurses (", " per 1,000).", "“You have all these hospitals, but what’s the quality of the health care?” Bouey said.", "And patient care could suffer beyond the Covid-19 wards.

According to ", ", people in the immediate area with diabetes and certain heart conditions (including those experiencing a heart attack) suffered higher mortality rates than patients elsewhere in China. Drugs that are critical for managing those diseases (insulin) or procedures that can avert a medical emergency (like stenting) were harder to get when the city’s hospitals were overwhelmed by Covid-19 patients.", "“We saw patients waiting in long lines at the hospital, with no family doctor to call,” Chen said. “Any consideration of a quick reopening is going to give all this pressure to the health care system.”", "Hospitals are doing what they can to prepare, but there are limits. Increasing the number of ICU beds by 10 percent, as the government recently ordered according to the WeChat report that Bouey shared with me, should not be a major problem. But finding the personnel for them would be. Every nurse who expected to enter the workforce through 2025 would need to work in their hospital’s ICU in order to fill the estimated 480,000 nursing positions that the country needs to staff 80,000 new ICU beds.", "“This can be a major barrier,” the report concluded. ", "The experts I spoke to also said that adequately staffing the Chinese health system, given the recent building bonanza, would take years. While the United States has also had staffing struggles during the worst of the pandemic, Chen pointed to traveling nurses as one way the US health system could fill staffing shortages (albeit imperfectly and at significant cost).", "No such reserve exists in China. They haven’t had time to build it.", "The country’s insistence that a zero-Covid strategy could work over the long term may end up making the exit wave worse, experts said. Countries like Australia and New Zealand that also employed zero-Covid plans were buying time to vaccinate their people and then they prepared for the reopening. But China has struggled to vaccinate its most vulnerable and it has not invested enough in building up its health system’s capacity in the meantime.", "“The government was so convinced zero Covid would work, so focused on measures necessary to sustain that, that not enough investment and preparation and planning” were put into a scenario in which it failed, Cowling said.", "More vaccinations would help, and the government recently announced that it would particularly target people over 80 in the weeks ahead. Cowling told me that, in an ideal world, China would try to maintain its zero-Covid strategy for three more months and go on a massive vaccination campaign. But the social and political climate may not allow that.", "The national government is trying to make the new normal more manageable and less disruptive for people and for the health care system. ", " is that, instead of locking down an entire apartment building or neighborhood when an infection is found, a person could quarantine at home.", "But a huge number of infections appears inevitable and a small but significant share of them will turn serious. As Cowling put it to me, even a small fraction becomes a problem if the denominator gets big enough. ", "So the world’s most populous country faces an uncertain future. It has spent three years holding Covid-19 back, but the virus is on the precipice of breaking through. Their health care system may not be ready. The stakes are high.", "“I know the wave will come once they open up,” Bouey said in our interview. When it does, Chen told me, “the health care system is not ready.”"]},

If and when it does (which, you know, we have a Congress that often doesn’t do much), it’s not entirely clear how implementation would work. Which resort fees are unfair and which are for a legitimate thing? Is there a way to opt out of whatever amenities they correspond to? What would travel website designs need to look like? What counts as a fair rate for quitting your phone plan early, and how much exactly does that cost the company dealing with it?

", "Another White House official who spoke to me on condition of anonymity said he’s heard in conversations with some companies that they’d be amenable to tighter rules around fees — assuming everyone else has to go along. If you’re a ticketing platform and you’re the only one showing full prices up front while all your competitors are going to add them on later, you’re at a disadvantage. Consumers won’t choose you if there’s no way for them to know you’re actually the right choice.", "“That’s bad for consumers and it’s bad for industry in the long run,” Klein said. “We should be competing on the best service and the best price, not on who can shock you with the most fees at the end.”"]},

Racism and white supremacy have created conditions of cyclic disadvantage. It’s not just about guns and it’s not just about access to food or about charity.

But when a Democratic administration exercised its lawful authority to abandon GOP policies, the Court slow-walked those cases — leaving dubiously reasoned lower court orders issued by Trump judges in place for months or longer.

Google’s search engine, moreover, is basically just one big recommendation algorithm that decides which links are relevant to a user’s query, and which order to list those links in.", "Thus, if Google loses its Section 230 protections because it uses algorithms to recommend content to users, one of the most important backbones of the internet could ", ". If a news outlet that is completely unaffiliated with Google publishes a defamatory article, and Google’s search algorithm surfaces that article to one of Google’s users, Google could potentially be liable for defamation.", "And yet, the question of whether Section 230 applies to websites that use algorithms to sort through content is genuinely unclear, and has ", " who typically approach the law in similar ways.", "In the ", " case itself, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that algorithms like the one YouTube uses to display content ", ". Among other things, the majority opinion by Judge Morgan Christen, an Obama appointee, argued that websites necessarily must make decisions that elevate some content while rendering other content less visible. Quoting from a similar Second Circuit case, Christen explained that “websites ‘have always decided ... where on their sites ... particular third-party content should reside and to whom it should be shown.’”", "Meanwhile, the leading criticism of Judge Christen’s reading of Section 230 was offered by the late Judge Robert Katzmann, a highly regarded Clinton appointee to the Second Circuit. Dissenting in ", " (2019), Katzmann pointed to the fact that Section 230 only prohibits courts from treating an online forum “as the publisher” of illegal content posted by one of its users. ", "Facebook’s algorithms do “more than just publishing content,” Katzmann argued. Their function is “proactively creating networks of people” by suggesting individuals and groups that the user should attend to or follow. That goes beyond publishing, and therefore, according to Katzmann, falls outside of Section 230’s protections.", "The likely reason for this confusion about what Section 230 means is that the law was enacted nearly three decades ago, when the internet as a mass consumer phenomenon was still in its infancy. Congress did not anticipate the role that algorithms would play in the modern-day internet, so it did not write a statute that answers the question of whether algorithms that recommend content to website users shatter Section 230 immunity with clarity. Both Christen and Katzmann offer plausible readings of the statute. ", "In an ideal world, Congress would step in to write a new law that strikes a balance between ensuring that essential websites like Google can function, while potentially including some additional safeguards against the promotion of illegal content. But the House of Representatives ", ", so the likelihood that the current, highly dysfunctional Congress will perform such a nuanced and highly technical task is vanishingly small. ", "And that means that the question of whether much of the internet will continue to function will turn on how nine lawyers in black robes decide to read Section 230.", "Let’s assume for a moment that the Supreme Court accepts the ", " plaintiffs’ interpretation of Section 230, and thus Google, Twitter, and Facebook lose their immunity from lawsuits claiming that they are liable for the ISIS attacks in Paris and Istanbul. To prevail, the plaintiffs in both ", "and ", " would still need to prove that these websites violated federal antiterrorism law, which makes it illegal to ", " to “an act of international terrorism.”", "The Supreme Court will consider what this statute means when it hears the ", " case. But this statute is, to say the least, exceedingly vague. Just how much “assistance” must someone provide to a terroristic plot before that assistance becomes “substantial?” Is it enough for the ", " plaintiffs to show that a tech company provided generalized assistance to ISIS, such as by operating a website where ISIS was able to post content? Or do those plaintiffs have to show that, by enabling ISIS to post this content online, these tech companies specifically provided assistance to the Istanbul attack itself?", "The ", " plaintiffs’ theory of what constitutes “substantial assistance” is ", ". They do not allege that Google, Facebook, or Twitter specifically set out to assist the Istanbul attack itself. Rather, they argue that these websites’ algorithms “recommended and disseminated a large volume of written and video terrorist material created by ISIS,” and that providing such a forum for ISIS content was key to “ISIS’s efforts to recruit terrorists, raise money, and terrorize the public.” ", "Perhaps that is true, but it’s worth noting that Twitter, Facebook, or Google are not accused of providing any special assistance to ISIS. Indeed, all three companies say that they have policies ", ", although ISIS was sometimes able to thwart these policies. Rather, as the Biden administration says in an amicus brief urging the justices to rule in favor of the social media companies, the ", "plaintiffs “allege that defendants knew that ISIS and its affiliates ", " around the world, and that defendants failed to actively monitor for and stop such use.”", "If a company can be held liable for a terrorist organization’s actions simply because it allowed that organization’s members to use its products on the same terms as any other consumer, then the implications could be astonishing. ", "Suppose, for example, that Verizon, the cell phone company, knows that a terrorist organization sometimes uses Verizon’s cellular network because the government occasionally approaches Verizon with wiretap requests. Under the ", " plaintiffs’ reading of the antiterrorism statute, Verizon could potentially be held liable for terrorist attacks committed by this organization unless it takes affirmative steps to prevent that organization from using Verizon’s phones.", "Faced with the threat of such awesome liability, these companies would likely implement policies that would harm millions of non-terrorist consumers. As the civil liberties groups ", ", media companies are likely to “take extreme and speech-chilling steps to insulate themselves from potential liability,” cutting off communications by all kinds of peaceful and law-abiding individuals.", "Or, worse, tech companies might try to implement a kind of ", ", whereby every phone conversation, every email, every social media post, and every direct message is monitored by an algorithm intended to sniff out terrorist sympathizers — and then deny service to anyone who is flagged by this algorithm. And once such a surveillance network is built, authoritarian rulers across the globe are likely to pressure these tech companies to use that network to target political dissidents and other peaceful actors.", "Despite all of these concerns, the likely reason why the ", "case had enough legs to make it to the Supreme Court is that the relevant antiterrorism law is quite vague, and court decisions do little to clarify the law. That said, one particularly important federal court decision provides the justices with an off-ramp they can use to dispose of this case without making Google responsible for every evil act committed by ISIS.", "Federal law states that, in determining whether an organization provided substantial assistance to an act of international terrorism, courts should look at “the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in ", ",” a 1983 decision that, in Congress’s opinion, “provides the proper legal framework for how such liability should function.”", "The facts of ", " could not possibly be more dissimilar than the allegations against Google, Twitter, and Facebook. The case concerned an unmarried couple, Linda Hamilton and Bernard Welch, who lived together and who grew fantastically rich due to Welch’s five-year campaign of burglaries. Welch would frequently break into people’s homes, steal items made of precious metals, melt them into bars using a smelting furnace installed in the couple’s garage, and then sell the precious metals. Hamilton, meanwhile, did much of the paperwork and bookkeeping for this operation, but did not actually participate in the break-ins.", "The court in ", " concluded that Hamilton provided “substantial assistance” to Welch’s criminal activities, and thus could be held liable to his victims. In so holding, the DC Circuit also surveyed several other cases where courts concluded that an individual could be held liable because they provided substantial assistance to the illegal actions of another person.", "In some of these cases, a third-party egged on an individual who was engaged in illegal activity — such as one case where a bystander ", " In another case, a student was injured by a group of students who were ", ". The court held that a student who threw no erasers, but who “", "” was legally responsible for this injury too.", "In yet another case, four boys broke into a church to steal soft drinks. During the break-in, two of the boys carried torches that started a fire that damaged the church. The court held that a third boy, who participated in the break-in but did not carry a torch, ", ". ", "One factor that unifies all of these cases is that the person who provided “substantial assistance” to an illegal activity had some special relationship with the perpetrator of that activity that went beyond providing a service to the public at large. Hamilton provided clerical services to Welch that she did not provide to the general public. A bystander egged on a single assailant. A student handed erasers to specific classmates. Four boys decided to work together to burglarize a church.", "The Supreme Court, in other words, could seize upon this unifying thread among these cases to rule that, in order to provide “substantial assistance” to a terrorist act, a company must have some special relationship with that organization that goes beyond providing it a product on the same terms that the product is available to any other consumer. This is more or less the same approach that the Biden administration ", ".", "Again, the most likely reason why this case is before the Supreme Court is because previous court decisions do not adequately define what it means to provide “substantial assistance” to a terrorist act, so neither party can produce a slam-dunk case which definitely tells the justices to rule in their favor. But ", "and related cases can very plausibly be read to require companies to do more than provide a product to the general public before they can be held responsible for the murderous actions of a terrorist group.", "Given potentially disastrous consequences for all internet commerce if the Court rules otherwise, that’s as good a reason as any to read this antiterrorism statute narrowly. That would, at least, neutralize one threat to the modern-day internet — although the Court could still create considerable chaos by reading Section 230 narrowly in the ", "case.", "In closing this long and complicated analysis of two devilishly difficult Supreme Court cases, I want to acknowledge the very real evidence that the algorithms social media websites use to surface content to their users can cause significant harm. As sociologist and Columbia professor Zeynep Tufekci wrote in 2018, YouTube “may be ", "” because of its algorithms’ propensity to serve up more and more extreme versions of the content its users decide to watch. A casual runner who starts off watching videos about jogging may be directed to videos about ultramarathons. Meanwhile, someone watching Trump rallies may be pointed to “white supremacist rants.”", "If the United States had a more functional Congress, then there may very well be legitimate reasons for lawmakers to think about amending Section 230 or the antiterrorism law at the heart of the ", " case to quell this kind of radicalization — though obviously such a law would ", ".", "But the likelihood that nine lawyers in black robes, none of whom have any particular expertise on tech policy, will find the solution to this vexing problem in vague statutes that were not written with the modern-day internet in mind is small, to say the least. It is much more likely that, if they rule against the social media defendants in this case, the justices will suppress internet commerce across the globe, that they will diminish much of the internet’s ability to function, and that they may do something even worse — effectively forcing companies like Google to become engines of censorship or mass surveillance.", "Indeed, if the Court interprets Section 230 too narrowly, or if it reads the antiterrorism statute too broadly, that could effectively impose the death penalty on many websites that make up the backbone of the internet. That would be a monumental decision, and it should come from a body with more democratic legitimacy than the nine unelected people who make up the Supreme Court."]},

", "In most cases, it’s the police who initiate the petition against individuals who have a criminal history, who have made threats of violence, or who present other behavioral risk factors. But in some states, family members of the individual, health professionals, and school administrators can also do so. Should the individual continue to present an immediate danger to themselves or others, the petitioner can go back to the court after the year is up and seek another order.", "The intention of these laws isn’t to criminalize people; it’s to stop guns from falling into the hands of those who have exhibited heightened risk of violent behavior and who don’t otherwise meet the threshold to be charged with a crime or involuntarily committed.

At the time that he was referred to police for the threats of violence that he made in school, he was under the legal age at which he could purchase a gun.

I think if he was older, that probably would have been their instinct,” Heyne said.", "Police might have also decided to pursue a protection order if they just had more training on the subject, said Josh Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.

When someone is formally charged with a crime, they have an opportunity to vindicate themselves at trial. If they are merely the subject of accusations tossed off by government officials, they have no real way to protect or rehabilitate their reputation.", "For these reasons, anyone eager to see how the investigations into Trump will end must have patience.

The ", ", a database of more than 200 million traffic stops, found that in St. Paul, Black drivers are a little over three times more likely than white drivers to be pulled over; in San Jose, California, Black drivers are six times more likely to be stopped.", "Arguably, drivers of all races ought to be stopped at about the same rate — anyone of any race or gender could engage in the reckless driving Nichols was allegedly stopped for. This has led to a number of researchers trying to understand the disparity in who is stopped. In general, their results suggest that the issue has to do with officer bias, conscious or unconscious, that casts Black people as inherently more dangerous than their white counterparts.", "Tied to this idea is the question of what stops are for. As a group of University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and Dartmouth College researchers led by Baumgartner wrote in a ", ", in many departments, traffic stops are meant to serve a dual purpose: to deter illegal behavior and as a chance for officers to investigative past or potential crimes. In many ways, this system is akin to stop-and-frisk, a practice ", " that was meant to uncover criminal behavior through street searches. The program was ruled unconstitutional.", "As Baumgartner wrote, “officers are trained to use traffic stops as a general enforcement strategy aimed at reducing violent crime or drug trafficking. When officers are serving these broader goals, they are making an investigatory stop, and these stops have little (if anything) to do with traffic safety and everything to do with who looks suspicious.”", "If Black drivers are seen as more suspicious and police are trained to view traffic stops as dangerous in general, this creates a serious problem. When a Black driver is stopped, the interaction is more likely to begin with the officer even more on guard for trouble than they might otherwise be.", "This can lead to the kind of rapid escalation seen in Nichols’s case, in which officers ended the stop through violence. Some officers favor beginning with violence, perhaps out of fear, like during the encounter that ended George Floyd’s life. Body camera footage released during Chauvin’s trial, for example, shows an officer drawing his weapon shortly after approaching Floyd’s vehicle and yelling at him to “Put your fucking hands up right now.”", "These tactics, as well as the fear and bias that fuel them, put Black drivers in mortal danger. Law enforcement representatives have argued the stops are necessary — “we find drugs, evidence of other crimes ... it’s a very valuable tool,” Kevin Lawrence, the Texas Municipal Police Association’s executive director, told the ", " in 2020 — but those discoveries are rare. Nationally, about 4 percent of stops resulted in searches or arrests in 2015, according to the ", ".", "This has a number of activists and elected officials questioning whether the risks traffic stops pose to drivers — particularly Black drivers — are worth such a small number of arrests.", "Politicians both on the national and local levels have expressed sadness and outrage over Nichols’s death.

It may gain more ground, but I don’t see a massive breakthrough where Ukrainian lines dissolve and the Russians drive deep into central Ukraine. I don’t think they have the capacity to do it.

That, if only there weren’t so many other candidates in the race, or if only those candidates hadn’t spent so much time attacking each other, or if only GOP elites coordinated more competently to back one challenger, Trump would have been stopped.", "But that smacks of wishful thinking that underestimates the sources of Trump’s strength and understates the weaknesses of his opponents back then. The failure to stop Trump in the 2016 primaries wasn’t an issue of elites playing their cards wrong or opposing campaigns making poor strategic choices.", "Party elites aren’t puppet masters who can rig the outcome. They’re not entirely powerless either — but they’re constrained in their choices, and trying to influence a dynamic that can be to a large extent determined by forces out of their hands. ", "In 2016, GOP elites’ problem was that there wasn’t a Trump alternative in the race who had credibility with both the party’s elites and its voters. There are already signs, though, that 2024 may be different.", "The 2016 GOP nomination contest began in confusion with the question: ", "? ", "Polls ", " throughout", "the second half of 2014 and the first half of 2015 (before Trump’s entry into the race) showed that a rotating cast of several candidates had roughly even support, but that nobody had all that much.

Some of these candidates were raising ", ", but none of them had broken out of the pack in polls, or in endorsements from other Republicans, ", ".", "Could this have been solved by greater party elite coordination around one candidate early? ", "Well, there’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg question — is the problem that the party failed to coordinate, or is it that there was simply no candidate running with the stature and skills to win widespread party support?", "Compare this to contests where one frontrunner “clears the field” of all but a few rivals — as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, and George W. Bush and Al Gore both did in 2000. All three of them ", " ", " their campaigns officially started, which helps explain why so many didn’t bother to run against them, and why they racked up endorsements — politicians like to back the likely winner!", "In the 2016 GOP contest, when candidates eventually did break from the pack in polls, they were, notably, different. Trump himself took the lead about a month after he entered the race in June, and held onto it for almost all of the race afterward. The only candidate to briefly tie him in national polls was another outsider — retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson — but Carson’s numbers declined by the late fall of 2015.

By the eve of the Iowa caucuses, Trump and Cruz together were pulling about 56 of the vote in national polls of Republicans, and Carson was getting another 7 percent. A veritable parade of noteworthy Republicans criticized Trump and said he must not win the nomination, but GOP voters were unmoved.

So, yes, they were splitting the establishment-friendly vote — but the establishment-friendly vote was very small. The claim that the problem was no establishment candidate had unified party elite support seems to miss the reality that voters just didn’t care about that support.", "It’s also a mistake to treat the establishment-friendly candidates as interchangeable. Indeed, there was widespread skepticism all along in the party that Bush, Kasich, or Christie — each of whom had a moderate streak — could ever appeal to conservative Republican voters nationally. ", "So really, the hopes that some establishment-friendly candidate could beat Trump hinged on just one person who many felt hit the sweet spot, and could appeal to all factions of the party: Rubio. ", "And as early state balloting approached, Rubio’s team referred to what became known as the “", "” — he wanted to finish third in the conservative-dominated Iowa caucuses, then second in New Hampshire, and then win South Carolina, and with that momentum, the party’s voters would flock to his banner before Super Tuesday.", "If there was a chance to stop Trump, it probably came after the Iowa caucuses, which Cruz won (and in which Rubio, as per the plan, came in third). And if the crowded field had an impact at all, it was probably in this specific moment. ", "In New Hampshire, Trump won with 35 percent of the vote, with his next closest competitor being Kasich with about 16 percent. Cruz, Bush, and Rubio each got about 11 percent, and Christie followed them with 7 percent. So if you combine the Kasich-Bush-Rubio-Christie New Hampshire vote, that totals about 44 percent of the vote, enough to top Trump. And in the next contest, South Carolina, the Rubio-Bush-Kasich vote (Christie had dropped out) was 38 percent, enough to top Trump’s 32 percent victory.", "But the assumption that all those candidates’ voters were one coherent “establishment” bloc that was dead-set against supporting Trump, and would have unified around any of those candidates, is wrong — some of those voters had Trump as their second choice!", "Rubio would surely have improved his position somewhat if Bush or Kasich had dropped out earlier. The evidence is mixed on whether he would have done so enough to win these states — ", " suggested Trump would have lost one-on-one contests with other candidates, and ", " he would have won head-to-head matchups with anyone else running. Yet we don’t have to imagine what would have happened if Rubio tried to take on Trump: We saw it, and it ", " for the Florida senator.", "By Super Tuesday, Rubio and Kasich were the two remaining establishment-friendly candidates. Of the 11 contests that day, Trump won seven, Cruz won three, and Rubio won one. Yet the combined Rubio-Kasich vote, if united around one candidate, would only have been sufficient to flip two Trump states — Virginia and Vermont. Rubio quit two weeks later after Trump beat him by nearly 20 percentage points in his own home state of Florida.", "Some argue that, if Rubio had only managed to win an early state, it all could have been different, as he would have seemed more credible to Super Tuesday voters. We’ll never know that for sure. Yet the Super Tuesday results largely resembled the polls before the early states even cast their ballots — Trump winning, Cruz in second, and Rubio in a distant third. ", "This suggests the contest’s dynamics were pretty entrenched, and it would have taken something quite dramatic to shake them up. But party elites had no power to create the perfect candidate from thin air — or to change its voters’ inclinations from anti-establishment to pro-establishment.", "If there’s anything political pundits are famous for, it’s fighting the last war. In 2016, so many commentators assumed the GOP race would play out the same way as it did in 2012, when various “outsider” candidates surged in the polls but then declined, as GOP voters settled for the establishment candidate, Mitt Romney. Now, pundits are assuming 2024 will play out just like 2016, with Trump triumphing over a divided field.", "But the ", " is already incredibly different than that for the 2016 contest. Rather than no frontrunner, there’s Trump, polling a little above 40 percent nationally. Then, though, there’s a clear second-place contender: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who’s polling a little above 30 percent nationally, far above every other potential candidate (all of whom poll in the single digits if they get any support at all).", "Recall that, in 2015, no candidate managed to top 17 percent in ", " until Trump’s rise. But now there are already two candidates well above that number, and looming well above the rest of the field — and one of them, DeSantis, isn’t even officially running yet.

That is: In the eyes of Republican voters nationally, he’s already made himself the clear leading Trump alternative. (Nikki Haley’s ", " into the race was generally greeted with intense ", ".)", "Now, DeSantis also faces a different problem than those past candidates — Trump is starting off in a much stronger position than he did in 2015. So DeSantis winning 35 percent likely won’t cut it — he needs to win more, and to the extent other candidates being in the race do lower his ceiling, that could be a problem.", "Still, this is a very different scenario from 2016, when it really wasn’t clear who the main alternative to Trump and Cruz was for quite some time. If polling very clearly shows a Trump versus DeSantis contest, voters will understand that, and they’ll adjust their strategic choices accordingly.", "So who’s responsible for DeSantis’s prominence? On one hand, you could argue that it’s a creation of party elites. Fox News ", " to its national audience starting in 2021, and there has been a long and deliberate effort by conservative commentators and activists to hype DeSantis. It could be viewed as a long-running GOP elite effort to foster and promote a Trump alternative who could be credible to both the party’s leaders and its base — something they simply did not have in 2016. ", "But you could also say it just comes down to DeSantis’s own actions. He built a political profile that resonated among national conservatives, cultivating Fox and other right-wing media outlets with strategically chosen culture war fights. There was certainly some anointing of DeSantis going on, but the anointed one has to be someone to whom voters will actually flock.", "So it’s too simple to say party elites could make DeSantis the nominee if they wanted. They have some limited influence in a larger process that also depends on choices by individual candidates, media outlets, and feedback from voters as expressed in polls. ", "Early presidential primary punditry has a way of going awry. The GOP contest could well look totally different later this year than it does right now. Unexpected candidates could rise, and the two front-runners could fall. But what’s already clear is that this contest looks quite different than 2016’s inchoate, divided field — and we shouldn’t expect it to follow the same track."]},

It’s about something bigger, broader, and a bit tougher to pin down: the “narrative.” Media coverage that is accurate and even arguably justified can create an unfair or misleading narrative, due less to the facts than to proportion, hype, tone, and implication.", "For instance, leading media outlets did not merely cover Trump-Russia — they made an editorial choice to treat it as the biggest and most important political story of 2017 and 2018.", "New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet referred to the scandal internally as “Chapter 1 of the story of Donald Trump, not only for our newsroom but, frankly, for our readers,” per ", ".", "This was, in many respects, a defensible decision. This was the investigation that seemed like it could bring down the president or at least lead to his impeachment. We now know that it didn’t, but hindsight is 20/20. The core question of whether Trump worked with Russia, if you believed it was unsettled, was important. And as Baquet suggests, in a sense they were following intense reader interest as well (as I know very well, being privy to the traffic statistics for many of Vox’s Trump-Russia stories from that period). It was always going to get coverage — a lot of coverage.  ", "Another question posed by the revisionists is whether the overall tone and tenor of the coverage was too suspicious of Trump, and whether media outlets were too quick to assume he had something to hide. ", "But recall that Trump fired the FBI director and then quickly ", " for why he did so, saying it was because of “the Russia thing.” Should the assumption have been that Trump had nothing to hide? (Gerth ", " Trump also saying that he thought the firing actually might prolong the Russia investigation, ignoring the false explanation Trump’s team initially offered for Comey’s firing and sounding rather too credulous about whether Trump truly would have let such an investigation proceed.)", "These tensions are inherent to modern political scandal coverage. For decades, the press’s model has been Watergate, in which reporting and investigation gradually, in drip-drip-drip fashion, revealed a dastardly cover-up and brought down the president.

But the reality is that when journalists come to the conclusion that a politician is fundamentally untrustworthy and trying to hide things, they tend to make a great effort to try to uncover those things — and sometimes they overreach in doing so.", "How should the media cover these unfolding investigations when information about them is incomplete and imperfect and the full story really isn’t initially clear? How much coverage is too much and how much is not enough? Can the press really know in advance which investigation is a nothingburger and which isn’t? These are tough questions with no easy answers.", "Coverage of Trump was fraught for another reason. Much of the media, the government, and the Democratic Party really did view him as a uniquely dangerous figure, an aspiring dictator with no ethical guardrails who would do anything to get and hold on to power. Were they right to suspect the worst of him?", "The revisionists have argued for years that they were wrong — that, driven by hysteria and partisanship, the liberal establishment exaggerated the threat Trump posed and that the real story was their own abuses of power. And as the Trump presidency settled into something like a routine and he seemed generally contained and constrained by his own administration and the sky didn’t fall, this may have seemed at least arguable. ", "But Trump’s behavior after the 2020 election torpedoed that defense, laying his character bare and revealing that, yes, he really was willing to go to shocking lengths to hold on to power. Knowing that, it hardly seems unreasonable for the press to have responded to his denials of Russian collusion with skepticism and to investigate whether it happened.", "To be clear, there was too much hysterical and flawed reporting in Trump-Russia coverage, and that shouldn’t be defended. But a great deal of thoughtful, rigorous, and newsworthy work took place on that beat too. Journalists did not in the end find that Trump cut a deal with the Kremlin in 2016, but they unearthed a great deal about Trump and his allies in the process.", "Dismissing the whole thing as a hoax or debacle — as the revisionists are doing — is too pat a dismissal.

", "“There is a lot of uncertainty about going the way you would have us go,” Kagan told Eric Schnapper, the plaintiffs’ lawyer.", "Schnapper argued that, while Section 230 does protect social media websites from the mere act of publishing users’ illegal content, it does not permit those websites to recommend such content to others. So if Facebook were to, for example, send an email to one of its users recommending that it click on a defamatory Facebook post, the company could be held liable for such a recommendation. ", "Under this theory, an algorithm that ranks content based upon what it thinks website users wish to see — so, for example, every Facebook user’s home feed — is no different from such an email recommending a particular Facebook post, and thus is beyond Section 230’s protections.", "But, as Chief Justice John Roberts suggested, it’s not entirely clear where to draw the line between content that is “recommended” by a website or other company, and content that is merely organized by that company. Suppose, for example, that a bookseller has a table where it places all the books related to sports. By grouping all the sports-related books together, this bookseller has engaged in the same sort of content organizing that an algorithm might engage in for a website. ", "But how is the Court supposed to draw a line between this benign sort of organization and an organizational system that actively recommends content to others? If YouTube’s algorithm starts flagging ISIS videos for a user who has already demonstrated an interest in terrorist organizations, is the algorithm recommending those videos, or merely organizing the terrorist-related content in the same way that the bookstore organized sports-related books?", "If the Court is looking for a way to dispose of this case without having to answer such difficult questions, Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised one possible way that it could do so. On Wednesday, the Court will hear oral arguments in a closely related case that asks whether social media websites ", " — assuming, of course, that Section 230 does not immunize these websites from such lawsuits.", "Barrett suggested that, if the Court determined that this anti-terrorist statute does not open social media websites up to such liability, then there’s no reason to decide the Section 230 question — and thus it can avoid many of the larger questions about how the internet should operate altogether.", "Though it seemed likely that at least five of the justices will agree that Google should not face liability every time its algorithms surface content that could lead to a lawsuit, the justices appeared split on what their opinion in ", " should actually say. And at least two justices appeared open to the possibility of reading Section 230 narrowly.", "Many of Justice Samuel Alito’s questions were, frankly, bizarre. And they suggested that he either does not understand how Section 230 functions, or that he does understand and wants to neutralize its protections regardless of what the law actually says.", "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, meanwhile, told Lisa Blatt, the lawyer for Google, that the problem of algorithms “was not what Congress was concerned about when it enacted this statute,” suggesting that she may agree with the plaintiffs that Section 230 does not protect websites if their algorithms serve up illegal content.

Kagan, Barrett, and Jackson all took turns beating up on this theory.", "One possible way that the Court could resolve this case was suggested by Justice Clarence Thomas early in the argument. Thomas noted that Google does not have a “focused algorithm with respect to terrorist activities,” and hinted that maybe websites should retain their legal immunity so long as their algorithm is “neutral” — meaning that it applies the same rules to all content rather than specifically trying to promote certain subject matters or viewpoints.", "Justice Neil Gorsuch, meanwhile, pointed to a provision of Section 230 that can be read to permit websites to “", "” as a reason to permit algorithms to function unmolested.

Instead of Europe importing gas via pipeline from Russia, the US (now the largest exporter of gas in the world) would condense it into its liquefied form to ship across the ocean. This would require a vast amount of infrastructure, investment, and permitting. ", "Germany has managed to build the fastest version of this, offshore floating terminals that can accept liquefied natural gas, in a single year. Julian Popov, a European Climate Foundation fellow, explained that the EU has plenty of excess capacity to import gas, but it’s just in the wrong places to ease the congestion. Remaking the EU’s entire fossil fuel system to accept US gas instead of Russian will take years to get up and running, longer if governments are doing their due diligence in reviewing permitting.

Gas companies building infrastructure might find that by the time it’s complete, it will be too expensive to compete with renewables.

If the world is serious about limiting climate change, industrialized countries already have all the fossil fuel infrastructure we can afford.

The investors will never see the return that they thought they were gonna get.”", "The EU has plenty of other challenges to sort out that don’t involve building redundant fossil fuel infrastructure. One is cracking harder renewable challenges, like scaling up mass storage for all the rooftop solar being installed. Another is replacing the millions of gas boilers, furnaces, and stoves in people’s homes that run on gas with heat pump and induction alternatives that use less electricity overall. ", "But the speed of the change over the last year suggests that these challenges can be overcome. If there’s one lesson Campanale suggests taking from the last year in Europe, it’s that “the fossil fuel system is going to go. The days of burning things to heat our home or to power to go from A to B are over.”"]},

Where is ours?” “We want a gym not a barn.” “Better library, better teachers, better schools.” They marched to the superintendent’s office with a list of demands. It was a sign of the civil rights-infused times — “the era of rising expectations among minority groups like the Mexican American youngsters” of the city, as the local San Antonio Express put it.", "A number of parents had joined in the protest, and soon organized the Edgewood Concerned Parents Association. “When I heard kids saying they didn’t think they could make it in college because of their high school education, then that’s when I decided it was time to do something,” one parent said.", "Demetrio Rodriguez — a sheet metal worker, military veteran, and then a father of three young boys — was among those frustrated parents. The group initially targeted their ire at district officials, concerned that they were self-dealing or hoarding money. But then they met with a local lawyer, Arthur Gochman, who pointed out that the district got dramatically less funding than others in the area. Maybe the schools’ problems stemmed not from mismanagement of money, but a lack of it.", "Since the advent of public education in America, property taxes had been schools’ biggest source of funding.

Teachers in Edgewood were paid much less than those in Alamo Heights. Probably because of that, half of them had only substandard credentials, compared to 11 percent in Alamo Heights, which also had more staff per student. Class sizes in Edgewood were an average of 28 kids. Alamo Heights had a counselor for every 650 students; Edgewood had one for every 3,100.

He claimed that IQ is nearly fixed at birth and that, therefore, extra funding for poor and Black children was doomed to fail because of what he viewed as their genetically low intelligence.

The race will likely offer a window into what the different, diverse demographic groups of the Democratic base want from the party, and lessons for how candidates can use their track records and biographies to make a broader pitch to voters. And it will likely be one of the most expensive Senate races in history: estimates by California politicos suggest the top candidates will have to spend anywhere from $", " to $", " to win. ", "In the video, Lee cast herself as an old-school progressive, highlighting her activism for women and LGBTQ+ Americans, her legislative record in California and in Congress, and her independence.

She is a trailblazer on a score of progressive concerns, leading on issues related to LGBTQ+ rights, women’s rights, and poverty before they became popular with the Democratic Party’s mainstream.", "Now she faces the central challenge of reminding voters of that legacy to distinguish herself from the other candidates trying to occupy the progressive wing of the party. She must do this while also quieting concerns about her age (she is 76, turning 77 this summer), and while raising money. (Schiff and Porter are two of the party’s best fundraisers, and raised more money on their campaign launch days than Lee had in the bank to begin with.)", "Given the national conversation about age in politics, Lee doesn’t seem too worried about concerns about her age just yet. “For those who say my time has passed, well, when does making change go out of style?” she stated in her announcement.

Porter ended the 2022 midterms cycle with more than $7 million of cash on hand; Schiff with $20 million; and they have both since raised millions more.

Despite the leftward lurch by candidates during the 2020 Democratic primary, the Biden administration has had a moderating effect on the party, even as Biden has accomplished many traditionally progressive economic goals like the (albeit temporary) expansion of the social safety net and action on climate change. ", "Part of Lee’s challenge will come from fundraising: She has said she won’t take corporate PAC money, and she acknowledges that as a Black progressive woman, she doesn’t have the same networks to raise money. Another comes from the state’s geography: Southern California simply has more voters than Northern California.", "But a Lee victory would mean more than a triumph for ideological progressives. There are currently no Black women serving in the US Senate, something she referenced in her launch: “Even though there are no African American women in the United States Senate, we won’t let that stop us either.” If elected, she’d be just the third Black woman to serve in the Senate.", "Her identity, lived experience, and track record all offer her ways to stand out from the mostly white crowd.

To explain, García Martínez ", " by conservative political theorist James Burnham: ", ". ", "Published in 1941, Burnham’s book predicted that capitalism had reached a terminal stage; the capitalist class’s power would soon decline, giving way to the rise of the “managerial class” — people who direct industry and the complex operations of the state. His examples of this new state were Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, which Burnham believed to be rooted in a more efficient economic model than liberal capitalism. For this reason, he predicted ", ".", "Burnham’s predictions were wildly wrong, in ways that should cast significant doubt on the viability of his entire theory of “the managerial revolution.” But his conceptualization of an unaccountable managerial class has nonetheless been extremely influential in the right-leaning tech world and in the broader conservative intellectual firmament.", "Marc Andreessen, a leading tech venture capitalist, ", " “the best explanation for the current structure of our society and politics.” ", ", a leading conservative policy intellectual, wrote that Burnham was “enjoying something of a revival” because “", ", ", ", and ", ", among others, have recently pointed to his work as essential to understanding the current political moment.”", "So, while Burnham’s work got some big things wrong, it’s still worth taking seriously.

After ", ", then-President Ronald Reagan said that he was “one of those principally responsible for the great intellectual odyssey of our century — the journey away from totalitarian statism and toward the uplifting doctrines of freedom.”", ", one of Burnham’s earliest and most influential works, shows signs of both his youthful Marxism and his later turn toward anti-communist conservatism. It begins with the very Marxist idea that history is, at root, a story of conflicting social groups struggling for control over a society’s wealth and means of production.", "“It is a historical law, with no apparent exceptions so far known, that all social and economic groups of any size strive to improve their relative position with respect to power and privilege in society,” he writes.", "Burnham also concurred with Marxists that the capitalist class would inevitably lose the contemporary iteration of this struggle — but disagreed about who would win it. In his view, the working class was too weak and disorganized to overthrow the capitalists in the way that Marxist theory predicted. Instead, he argues, a new group was rising: the managerial class.", "Managers, in Burnham’s definition, are the people responsible for “the tasks of the technical direction and coordination of the process of production.” This does not mean technical experts, like chemists or architects, but the people that direct these technical experts: “operating executives, superintendents, administrative engineers, supervisory technicians; or, in government ... administrators, commissioners, bureau heads, and so on.”", "The managerial class’s growing strength stems from two elements of the modern economy: its technical complexity and its scope. Because the tasks needed to manage the construction of something like an automobile require very specific technical knowledge, the capitalist class — the factory’s owners, in this example — can’t do everything on their own. And because these tasks need to be done at scale given the sheer size of a car company’s consumer base, its owners need to employ others to manage the people doing the technical work. ", "As a result, the capitalists have unintentionally made themselves irrelevant: It is the managers who actually control the means of production. While managers may in theory still be employed by the capitalist class, and thus subject to their orders, this is an unsustainable state of affairs: Eventually, the people who actually control the means of production will seize power from those who have it in name only.", "How would this happen? Mainly, through nationalization of major industry.

Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, with their state-directed economies, provided a blueprint that the rest of the world would soon follow. The United States hadn’t made the leap, but the rise of the administrative state after the New Deal proved it was heading there.", "Hence, “the managerial revolution”: the inevitable decline of capitalist democracy and the rise of a new social regime defined by managerial control of the economy using “the unlimited state” as a vehicle. ", "At first blush, Burnham’s theory is not an especially promising candidate for explaining the world today.", "Virtually all of ", " major predictions — the coming collapse of capitalism, an Axis victory in World War II, the superior efficiency of state-run enterprises — were proven wrong. The power of the capitalist class has become more entrenched since the neoliberal revolution of the 1970s and ’80s and attendant skyrocketing inequality.

But it is anyone’s guess how the justices will write an opinion that reaches this conclusion.", "The plaintiffs’ legal theory in ", " is ", ". They claim that the terrorist group ISIS used Twitter and similar websites to promote its views and to recruit followers.

If a terrorist buys a Ford truck, loads it with explosives, and then detonates this truck-turned-bomb near a federal building, the victims of such an attack typically cannot sue Ford.", "In fairness, JASTA does place one important limit on plaintiffs’ ability to target any company that might have some attenuated connection to a terrorist act. A defendant sued under JASTA must “knowingly” provide substantial assistance to someone who commits an act of terrorism. So, in the Ford truck hypothetical, Ford could likely defend itself against a lawsuit by saying it did not know that its truck would be used in such a destructive way.

If the police chief calls up local businesses and tells them not to conduct business with this suspected criminal, would those businesses have to comply out of fear that they could later be sued for aiding and abetting a crime?", "As Alito’s hypothetical suggests, one problem that arises out of JASTA is that businesses will often be aware that some of their products are being used illegally, but may not have any reasonable way to stop this illegal activity. There are multiple media, ", ", and ", ", for example, pointing out that many Twitter accounts are used by individuals associated with ISIS.

Instead, many of the justices appeared to take turns tossing out possible ways to read JASTA in order to protect companies like Twitter from excessive liability.", "Barrett, for example, suggested two possible rules. One is that the Court could rule it is not enough to show that Twitter provided some vague assistance to ISIS. Instead, they would need to claim that Twitter actually assisted the particular terrorist attack that killed a particular plaintiff — in this case, the 2017 attack in Istanbul.

", "And there’s also a fifth possible way to dispose of this case. On Tuesday, the Court heard arguments in a closely related case asking whether a federal law, ", ", immunizes social media companies from this kind of JASTA lawsuit. If the Court determines these companies are immune under Section 230, that would obviate the need to figure out how JASTA applies to social media — at least for now.", "Ultimately, the ", " case is messy because Congress wrote a messy law. JASTA does not adequately define key terms like “substantial assistance,” and the most guidance it does offer is a citation to a vague court decision handed down 40 years ago. That’s not how Congress should behave when it writes important national security laws that make non-terrorists legally responsible for terrorism.", "But the Supreme Court has to wrestle with the laws that Congress actually wrote, not the laws we might wish that Congress had drafted.

The documents show in detail how Twitter made key content moderation decisions that disadvantaged Trump, conservatives, and people who broke with the public health consensus on Covid-19. They say the evidence proves that, again and again, Twitter intervened to squelch speech that the liberal establishment didn’t like.", "Meanwhile, others — including most liberals and many mainstream journalists — are unimpressed. They say Twitter’s policies here were already known and that the specific decisions in question — blocking a story they feared stemmed from a foreign hack, banning the account of President Trump after he incited an insurrection, and deboosting accounts spreading public health misinformation — generally seem at least defensible.", "The discourse has quickly become one of us versus them — perfect for Twitter. The journalists to whom Musk gave the documents — most prominently, Substackers Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss — are outspoken, unsparing critics of what they believe is the “woke” liberal groupthink that pervades mainstream American media institutions, making them now effectively allies of the right in the culture war.

Additionally, some fear that the documents are being selectively pruned to tell a preferred story that could lack context.", "Still, it is worth evaluating the documents on their own merits to the extent we can, without a too-hasty dismissal of all Taibbi and Weiss’s arguments or a defense of Twitter’s old management regime. That regime is gone now, but while they were in place, Twitter was a powerful institution that had a major impact on politics, and its decisions deserve scrutiny — just as decisions made by Twitter’s new regime, or ", ", deserve scrutiny. Some of the previous management’s decisions, it seems to me, were wrong, and indeed arguably driven by liberal groupthink. Others I’m less certain about, but they’re at least worth discussing. So here are the main decisions being second-guessed.", "The ", ", from Taibbi, focuses on Twitter’s October 2020 decision to outright ban links to the first ", " about Hunter Biden’s laptop. The ban lasted a little over one day before Twitter lifted it, but the recriminations have continued ever since.", "Twitter’s justification was that the story violated its policy against posting “hacked materials.” However, the Post said the materials came from a laptop abandoned at a computer repair store, not a hack. There was widespread skepticism of this claim at the time, but there was no evidence for the hack supposition, and none has since emerged. So what was Twitter thinking?", "One clue is in ", " by Trust and Safety chief Yoel Roth, who alludes to “the SEVERE risks here and lessons of 2016.” In 2016, there was an effort by the Russian government to interfere with the general election in a way that would hurt Hillary Clinton and Democrats’ prospects. As later documented in the ", ", this effort involved both a “troll farm” of Russian accounts masquerading as Americans to spread false or inflammatory information, and the “hack-and-leak” campaign in which leading Democrats’ emails were stolen and provided to WikiLeaks.", "After Trump won, many leading figures in politics, tech, media, and law enforcement concluded that major social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook should have done more to stop this Russian interference effort and the spread of “misinformation” more generally (with some arguing that this was a problem regardless of electoral impact, and others claiming that this helped or even caused Trump’s victory). Law enforcement officials argued the Russian campaign was illegal and ", " about two dozen Russians believed to be involved in it. Social media companies began to take a more aggressive approach to curbing what they saw as misinformation, and as the 2020 election approached, they met regularly with FBI and other government officials to discuss the dangers of potential new foreign interference campaigns.", "But several issues are being conflated here. Misinformation is (in theory) false information. Foreign propaganda is not necessarily false, but it is being spread by a foreign government with malicious intent (for example, to ", "). Hacked material, though, is tricker in part because it often isn’t misinformation — its power comes from its accuracy. Now, it is theoretically possible that false information could be mixed in with true information as part of a hacked document dump, so it’s important to authenticate it to the extent possible. And even authentic information can often be ripped out of context to appear more damning than it really is. Still, Twitter was putting itself in the awkward position where it would be resolving to suppress information that could well be accurate, for the greater good of preventing foreign interference in an election.", "More broadly, a blanket ban on hacked material doesn’t seem particularly well thought through, since a fair amount of journalism is based on material that is illicitly obtained in some way (such as the ", "). Every major media source wrote about the ", " and ", " email leaks, as well as the leaked ", ", while entertainment journalists wrote about the ", ". Should all those stories be banned like the Post’s was? A standard that Twitter won’t host any sexual images of someone posted without their consent, or any personal information like someone’s address, is a neutral one. Beyond that, determining what stolen or hacked information is newsworthy is inherently subjective. Should that judgment be left to social media companies?", "Then there’s the problem that Twitter jumped to the conclusion that this was a hack in the first place. I can see why they did — recent high-profile examples of mass personal info dumps like this were generally hacks. So if you had been anticipating a chance to “do over” 2016’s hack scandal, here it seemed to be. But it was jumping to a conclusion. Additionally, the apparent belief of some employees that proactively censoring the story until there was more information about whether it was hacked info was a way to express “", "” seems dubious — fully banning a link to a media outlet from the platform was a sweeping measure.", "So to me this seems a pretty clear case of overreach by Twitter. This wasn’t a “rigging” of the election (again, the ban was only in place for a little over a day).

Only later did top executives ask about other possible interpretations and begin discussing whether this was a coded “glorification of violence” interpretation.

They aren’t Trumpists (Taibbi is historically of the left, ", " she voted for Biden, Musk said ", " Ron DeSantis) but they’ve become united by a loathing for what they see as the liberal groupthink that has become hegemonic in much of the media and Silicon Valley, which they argue chills dissent and free speech, and often advances the interests of the Democratic Party. This includes “wokeness” and cancel culture, but goes beyond those topics. For instance, they believe Trump got a raw deal in the Russia investigation — arguing many in the media, the Democratic Party, and the government either believed or willfully perpetrated what amounted to a false conspiracy theory that Trump was in cahoots with Vladimir Putin. Whatever they might believe about Trump’s flaws, their commentary shows that for some time they have been far more animated by what they see as the excesses of Trump’s opponents in the media, tech companies, and the government.", "If you’re inclined to think Trump a singular threat that must be resisted — and you can point to the January 6 attacks as proof of your theory — then a major social media company banning him is more justifiable. But if you think the liberals at the social media company are themselves a major threat to speech, then the power they wielded in banning Trump may disquiet you.", "Yet it should be noted that the phenomenon of controversial Twitter bannings occurring at top executives’ whims has not been solved under the Musk regime.

Apple has but a scant 1.7 percent of the digital ad market in the US, according to Insider Intelligence. It’s still a pretty limited business since it’s only advertising on a few of its own properties for now. That small size and limited reach may help Apple when it comes to potential antitrust issues.

It’s a way to both keep the existing subscribers and get more of them, Derdenger said. ", "Apple’s ad push comes at a time when Big Tech is under heavy scrutiny by antitrust enforcers and lawmakers. The App Store has been a big point of contention for some of these parties, and anything that uses that App Store control to fuel success and revenue in a different market is going to get their attention. ", "“The high-level issue that Apple must wrestle with all the time is that somebody somewhere is going to develop a theory that looks at the use of those advantages in any market in which they operate,” said William Kovacic, who served as chair of the FTC under President George W. Bush. “It doesn’t matter how nascent your effort is, how limited your successes, even if it’s something you’ve never touched before in your life.”", "Kovacic said Apple could be seen as leveraging its position of power in one market to get an unfair advantage in another. Apple’s longstanding argument — that it can ensure the privacy and security of its users by maintaining the only app store — has worked for a while, including ", " with Epic Games. The judge in that case said she found “Apple’s security justification to be a valid and nonpretextual business reason for restricting app distribution.” But that argument may get less convincing the more things competitors and enforcers can point to that show Apple has used its App Store control to enrich itself at the expense of others. ", "Also on Apple’s side may be antitrust laws in the US and the modern courts’ interpretation of them. As Hal Singer, a professor of economics at the University of Utah and director of the ", ", put it, “Antitrust tends to grant, like, an immunity to conduct that’s happening within the firm’s boundaries.” ", "So much of what Apple does occurs within those boundaries because Apple controls so many aspects of its products, including its ad business, from where user data is collected to where the ads appear. Singer, who frequently serves as an expert witness in antitrust lawsuits, thinks that as long as Apple isn’t requiring developers to purchase ads to be allowed into the App Store, it would be difficult to make a case that the search ads are an antitrust violation. ", "“You have to establish, among other things, that there’s a restraint of trade that is either allowing the firm to maintain its monopoly or to extend its monopoly to some adjacent market,” he said.  ", "The difficulty making antitrust cases against Big Tech companies in the US is part of the reason why some members of Congress wanted to outlaw ", " that could be seen as anti-competitive. The two bills that made it the furthest in the legislative process would have affected Apple’s App Store. The first, the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, would have forbidden it from giving its own products an advantage over others in its App Store. The second, the Open App Markets Act, would have forced it to allow third-party app stores on its devices. Both bills were waiting for a floor vote in the Senate and ", ", to what must have been Apple’s delight.", "The Department of Justice is ", " preparing to sue Apple for antitrust violations including its App Store, a case that has been in the works ", ". If that case is filed, there will likely be years of litigation that the DOJ may very well not win. ", "Right now, Apple’s greatest antitrust threat isn’t in the US; it’s in other countries that have stronger antitrust regulations and are ready to use them. The EU’s Digital Markets Act will force Apple to allow third-party app stores on its devices by 2024, something the company has done everything in its power to resist. Apple is ", " preparing for that eventuality now, although it’s only allowing those app stores where it legally has to — that is, not in the US. ", "The US will get to watch and see how third-party app stores on Apple devices work out. It could weaken or strengthen Apple’s argument for why they’re so dangerous, depending on how things go. It’s also possible that Apple’s ads push is an attempt to get a more significant revenue stream going in another services arm just in case Apple’s App Store revenue takes a hit when third-party app stores are allowed.", "“Advertising is a way to hedge their bet,” Derdenger said.", "Very few people want to see more ads in their lives. So when they start appearing in more places on their phones, it’s doubtful that many of Apple’s customers will welcome the change. But Apple isn’t doing anything that its competitors aren’t, and it says it’s doing it in a way that’s better for its users than what those other companies do. If those ads help Apple reduce the price of some of its services, that might not be a bad deal for users, either. ", "Advertisers who blame Apple for the hit their industry has taken probably don’t feel the same way, but their opinions might not matter much. In the US, antitrust law and how courts interpret it still have a lot to do with consumer welfare. Apple is very good at selling potentially anti-competitive moves as being necessary to keep its customers happy and safe, and it’s making the same case for its ad business."]},

", "The deal marks the first time in Amazon’s history it has made a bevy of changes as the result of a government investigation, and it could serve as a blueprint for deals that regulators in the US could push for over concerns of anti-competitive behavior.", "But at least one of the big changes that EU antitrust officials are framing as an Amazon concession had already been under consideration inside the company for many years, according to two sources familiar with the initiative. Another change Amazon agreed to make in Europe — to stop using certain data it collects about sellers on its third-party marketplace — is a shift that won’t actually impact the company because this data is not particularly useful, a source told Recode.", "So while Amazon’s deal appears to be a win for regulators, it may include changes the company can easily accept because they won’t materially affect its competitive edge. ", "“It appears Amazon’s strategy all along was to make it seem like it was giving things up that it was perfectly comfortable to give up,” one of the sources said.", "Amazon has until the summer to make these and other agreed-upon changes, which will apply to its shopping sites across the EU other than in Italy, where the government has undergone its own investigation into the tech giant. ", "Amazon and spokespeople for the European Union’s antitrust commission did not respond to a request for comment.", "In the first instance, the change in question involves Amazon’s “Buy Box,” the section of the shopping site that shows the price and delivery date for a given product, along with “Add to Cart” and “Buy Now” buttons. When there are multiple parties that sell the same product, Amazon’s algorithm chooses which business “wins” the Buy Box and gets the sale. With the EU deal, Amazon has agreed to start displaying two Buy Boxes on its sites in Europe when there is a second competing offer that is materially different in price and/or delivery speed. The idea is that third-party sellers will now have a better chance to get in front of shoppers when competing against Amazon for the sale of the same product.", "Yet inside Amazon, a similar idea had already been discussed since at least 2018, before any major known antitrust investigations into the company, according to multiple sources. Dubbed Project Packard, the initiative aimed to show multiple Buy Box offers to shoppers in an effort to provide more options for customers, including the option to wait longer for an item if it meant getting it for a cheaper price.

This applies to both Amazon’s automated tools and employees that could cross-use the data from Amazon Marketplace, for retail decisions.” The use of this data was seen as unfair because it could help Amazon’s retail business, which stocks and sells some of the very same merchandise as its sellers, gain a competitive advantage over those sellers. The data could also be used to help Amazon clone popular products for its private-label brands.   ", "Amazon already had a policy against its employees or systems using non-public data from individual Amazon sellers, but that policy was occasionally broken, according to ", ".

Earlier this year, Recode reported that some Amazon executives had been on board with the idea of ", " altogether if it meant avoiding harsher remedies in any potential antitrust investigations. Amazon is still in that business, however, and the new deal with the EU does not directly affect that business line.", "The agreement also includes several changes related to the role Amazon Prime plays for the company.

The OHSB report criticized specific producers, including head producer Ryan Smith, for failing to take workplace safety concerns seriously despite repeated complaints by staff. Pickle also faced scrutiny for actively scolding Gutierrez-Reed, including ordering her off armorer duty and limiting her time spent training the cast and crew on how to safely handle weapons.", "It seems baffling, given this type of evidence, that Santa Fe prosecutors opted not to bring charges of negligence against the producers — charges that seem clearly provable according to the available evidence.

", "On the other hand, TikTok is taking some novel approaches to try to shed light on its data practices and algorithms. Under TikTok’s USDS plan, a group of Oracle employees and security experts are supposed to be monitoring the company’s proprietary algorithms that dictate what millions of people see every day when they log in to the app. We don’t have that level of outside accountability for Facebook or YouTube. Companies like Meta and Google also track massive amounts of our personal information online but don’t attract the same type of national security concerns as TikTok because they’re American companies. Even if TikTok is now sharing information out of political necessity, it’s a net positive to society that they’re sharing any information at all.", "It’s yet to be seen whether TikTok will manage to change minds on Capitol Hill. While these latest initiatives are a first step, it is going to take a lot more — and the validation of outside partners and experts — to persuade TikTok’s strongest skeptics."]},

On January 31, ", " that Riseborough would keep her nomination but that “tactics” were being “addressed with the responsible parties directly.”", "And those intimations about dicey tactics are a little surprising, if you know anything about how Oscar winners are made. ", "Let’s back up. The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences — that is, the industry group made up entirely of people who work in the industry (but no journalists or critics) — gives out the Oscars, and the group is made up of distinct “branches.” There’s a branch for cinematographers, another for writers, another for directors, and so on. Each branch votes on nominations in its own discipline, ultimately picking five nominees. The exception is Best Picture, which has 10 nominee slots and is voted on by the entire membership, which numbers around 10,000. After nominees are announced, everyone gets to vote in every category.", "The idea here is noble: You know your craft, so you’re best suited to pick the five options from which the broader membership will choose the winners. Simple, right?", "Except the Oscars have never been simple, for a lot of reasons. The American film industry is mostly based in Los Angeles, which is a company town. That means everybody knows everybody — not just knows, but marries, divorces, drinks with, sees at bake sales, hires and fires and hears rumors about. Exceptions abound, of course, but it’s a bit like choosing winners among your very extended family. No wonder the whole thing can feel like a popularity contest.", "Another wrinkle is that the prospect of choosing “the best” art is categorically ridiculous. Some things are better than others, sure. But taste is inherently subjective — ", " — and when you’re operating on the technical level of most movies, judgments of “best” boil down to taste. The endless awards season has its reasons for existing; recognition for one’s work ", ". But the fiction that a group can vote to choose the best of something is silly, laughably so. ", "But the main issue with choosing the Oscars is simply that they’re not a contest of craft at all. They’re a contest of  politics. I don’t mean that they’re “political,” though the long, long history of Hollywood is one of Washington and Hollywood meddling in one another’s business. (Anyone who says movies were better when they were “less political” has made up some Hollywood in their head with no ", " to the ", " ", ".)

This is so true that ", ", I found political consultants were as knowledgeable about the process as awards strategists (and more open about it, too).", "Yet there’s one big difference. When you’re campaigning for president, all bets are off. You can relentlessly knock on doors, call and text and email constituents, and outright ask for their vote. In American politics, it’s perfectly fine to be a candidate who walks up to someone on the street, hands them a flier, and says, “I am Alissa Wilkinson, I’m running for president, and I’m asking for your vote.”", "But there’s a strange skittishness in the Academy around such bold displays of campaigning — if anyone notices. Andrea Riseborough doesn’t appear to have been knocking on doors personally, but ", " director Michael Morris’s wife, the actress Mary McCormack, ", ". Variety reported that ", " in the Academy, asking them to “post every day between now and Jan 17th” — the last day of Oscar nominations voting.

Reportedly, she also held a small gathering ", " (something the Academy doesn’t allow, in certain parameters, without an accompanying screening).", "What’s ironic, as many have pointed out — like Riseborough’s co-star ", " and actress ", " — is that while many movies don’t have such an overt campaign (or, at least, not one we know about), there’s plenty of campaigning going on. ", ": ", "(Perhaps most ironically, the modern-day template for campaigns that cost millions of dollars and ", " was created, more or less single-handedly, by none other than Harvey Weinstein.)", "In the end, the question is whether a movie that visibly violated the campaign rules should be punished, allowing the Academy to maintain the polite fiction that much more expensive campaigns with less overt (but still obvious) tactics should be permitted to continue. ", "And all of this points to what seems to me like a bigger issue. The American presidential election system has been hopelessly mediatized and increasingly hysterical. The hype-and-fear cycle begins years ahead of the actual election, as if it’s an epic live sports showdown and not a sober civic ritual designed to produce justice and fairness.", "The Oscars are, in fact, a live showdown, and if you think they’re about justice and fairness then you may want to buy this bridge I’ve got down in Brooklyn. But the Oscars cycle does have a negative effect on the movies, regardless. As I’ve written, the hype cycle, the endless “will it win an Oscar?” questioning, the informal campaigning begins about a month after the Oscars and continues all year. By September’s fall festival cycle, the “frontrunners” are all but established, making it hard for any surprises to break through. The question of whether a movie is “Oscar-worthy” can subsume the movie itself, making it hard to talk about it as a work of art. It’s all about its awards potential, and films get swept up in the vortex.", "If the Academy were to put a tighter rein on all campaign activities — not just grassroots campaigns that are a little too obvious for its taste — it might not solve that problem. But it could also work to level the playing field, allowing more films to enter the conversations and even be seen by more people. Maybe it wouldn’t lead to a movie business less hellbent on awards-grubbing — but wouldn’t it be worth trying?"]},

Throughout both shows, Jeff and Rick earnestly, even plaintively continue to wonder why they’re such walking disasters — at least they do when they can overcome their self-loathing long enough to get the question out. Why do people do bad things? Harmon wants to know, and he wants us to want to know. ", " is a weird little cartoon comedy about alien monsters and sexual fetishes, but it’s probably the best cartoon comedy about alien monsters and sexual fetishes ever made. Roiland’s behavior has associated his callous, sexually depraved characters, whose actions are the insightful work of many talented people, with genuine real-world cruelty. Is that a script problem? I don’t know. I also don’t know whether it would be a script problem even Harmon can solve. But I hope he tries."]},

While Reyes-Illg treats her patients’ heatstroke, with VSD+, that same condition is induced on purpose, with the AVMA’s stamp of approval. “I think if you surveyed the veterinarians in the United States, the vast majority of them have no idea that this is happening, and if they knew they would be outraged,” said Reyes-Illg, who is a veterinary advisor to the Animal Welfare Institute and is among the veterinarians organizing to withdraw their profession’s support for VSD+. More than", "1,500 vets have signed a ", "urging the AVMA to stop condoning the method. So far, their efforts have been unsuccessful", "The controversy over ventilation shutdown represents the most recent, high-profile example of long-simmering tensions over veterinary medicine’s values. While the public associates veterinarians with cats and dogs, imagining it as a job for animal lovers, veterinary medicine is also deeply embedded in the factory farm system. Veterinarians provide the research, expertise, and scientific and moral authority that allows the US to raise ", " land animals in intensive confinement every year. ", "“At present, the official stance of the veterinary profession in the US often serves to legitimize practices that cause extreme, prolonged pain and suffering on a massive scale, such as intensive confinement and the use of heatstroke as a method of mass on-farm killing,” Reyes-Illg said in an email. “The veterinary profession helps shield such practices from questioning and criticism.” But a new generation of veterinarians is challenging what they see as the", "“corporate capture” of their profession, as vet Crystal Heath put it, by the meat industry and other sectors that kill animals for profit. ", "If they’re successful, they argue, they could help topple a crucial pillar of support for factory farming. While the AVMA doesn’t control what methods meat producers choose to use, the veterinary profession’s positions inform legislation and rule-making around how animals are allowed to be treated. The USDA’s rules on how to kill poultry birds due to avian flu, for example, are taken directly from AVMA guidelines. Vets are also, in my experience, the preferred excuse used by the meat industry and regulators to justify extreme cruelty. Ask an agriculture department bureaucrat why they’re condoning mass extermination via heatstroke, and they’re likely to shrug and say, it’s AVMA-approved (that is almost verbatim what I was told by Chloe Carson, who was then the communications director for Iowa’s agriculture department, in April).", "“The AVMA is critical in our political system for animal welfare, so Congress tends to think of the AVMA when it comes to animal things,” said", "livestock veterinarian James Reynolds, a professor at Western University’s vet school. “Congress will take no action until the AVMA changes its position” on how animals are treated in the food system.

But in a ", " filed in June, the American Association of Swine Veterinarians, an organization closely tied to the pork industry, urged the Court to strike down Prop 12. “Proposition 12 is likely to harm animal welfare rather than help it,” the group argued. ", "When she read that brief, Reyes-Illg remembers, “I was horrified that this might be the sole message the Supreme Court would hear from veterinarians about gestation crates.” She led an effort to submit a ", " to the court, which was signed by 378 veterinarians and animal welfare scientists,", "refuting the swine veterinarians’ claims as inaccurate and driven by pork industry interests. “The weight of the scientific evidence strongly supports the conclusion that gestation crates cause profound, avoidable suffering and deprive pigs of a minimally acceptable standard of welfare,” they wrote.

Today, most US veterinarians ", " companion animals, like cats, dogs, and other pets,", "but it wasn’t always that way. Modern veterinary medicine has its origins in treating animals raised for food and horses used for transportation. “I don’t think there’s any question that in North America, organized veterinary medicine” — institutions like the AVMA — “by and large reflects that history,” said Lisa Moses, a veterinarian and bioethicist at Harvard Medical School.", "“The people who are the national spokespeople for veterinary medicine are still very much entrenched in food production and in the agriculture industry in a way that the majority of practicing veterinarians are not.” ", "These disparities, combined with the factory farm-ification of animal agriculture, have led to a “growing schism between the companion animal side of the field and the food animal production side of the field,” Moses said. ", "As meat production industrialized, the profession accommodated it. “The veterinary response was largely a technocratic one, technological, and very much politically aligned with animal production,” said Susan Jones, a science historian at the University of Minnesota and a veterinarian. Economic shifts in agriculture necessarily drove changes in how industry vets viewed their patients, “seeing animals less as living sentient beings and seeing them more as production units,” Jones said. “This means that [vets] don’t see animals anymore as individuals in need of health care or welfare considerations. You see them as populations.” ", "Veterinarian Crystal Heath, who is one of the best-known critics of her profession’s relationship with the meat industry,", "seeks every opportunity to start conversations about how vets could end the biggest harms facing animals, like ventilation shutdown, rather than participate in them. She arrived at the AVMA convention in late July with that goal in mind. On her first day there, she and her friend Daniela Castillo, a fellow vet pushing for change in the profession, said they noticed being watched by a security guard. When they approached to ask him what was going on, he explained that he’d been told to look out for them because they might be protesting. “Obviously, we’re being surveilled,” Heath said in a ", " posted to Twitter that evening. “It seems like the AVMA is extremely unwelcoming and is not supportive of people who are doing animal advocacy.” The AVMA declined to comment on these allegations. ", "Heath, a Berkeley-based shelter veterinarian who devotes much of her time to spaying and neutering cats and dogs,", "was used to this kind of treatment. Her advocacy has made her a lightning rod within the profession. While she’s hardly the first vet to voice misgivings about factory farming, she’s done so particularly publicly — often bringing her critiques to social media, engaging with audiences outside the profession, and posting ", " of veterinarians conducting gruesome research on the meat industry’s behalf. “We should use our innovation to end the exploitation of animals instead of devising more macabre killing methods,” she said in a ", " last fall.", "And although she grew up steeped in animal agriculture, she’s now vegan, which can feel like an existential threat to industry veterinarians. ", "“I was vice president of my 4H club,” an organization that trains kids in animal agriculture, Heath said. “I raised goats; I was an animal science major.” Now, she said, some veterinary colleagues view her as biased for repudiating animal agriculture, but she points out that the bias runs both ways: “I could easily argue that ", " have a biased perspective because you are committed to eating animal products. I look at all of these people who they consider to be unbiased, and they all work for industry.” ", "A 2020 ", " revealed how Heath was branded an extremist and targeted for her advocacy by the meat industry. A flier of unknown provenance had circulated on Facebook, displaying her photo under the warning “BEWARE” and claiming she supported the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front, radical groups from an earlier era of animal activism, which she said she knew nothing about at the time. “I got kicked out of all the veterinary Facebook groups that I relied on on a daily basis for networking,” she remembers. Some livestock vets openly berated her. “Crystal your deranged activism here and throughout the animal agriculture industry is quite annoying,” one vet commented on a post she made in a Facebook group. “[Y]ou’re literally, by name, a topic of conversation in board rooms from Ag business to organized veterinary medicine across the nation. Your name is literally toxic.”  ", "Heath regularly receives messages from vets and veterinary students who sympathize with her but say they’re afraid to speak out because of the potential consequences for their careers. Daniela Castillo, who’s worked extensively in shelters and spay-and-neuter, said that she’s been ridiculed so much for being vegan that she’s considered leaving veterinary medicine — a problem she feels is compounded by being a woman of color in an ", " profession. “People become so defensive,” she said. “They either get angry or they treat you as a joke.” ", "Heath realized that veterinarians needed a support network to be able to withstand industry retaliation. In fall 2020, she founded ", ",", "a nonprofit that helps vets challenge unethical practices in their profession. It was a few months after the public learned about ventilation shutdown — not in the poultry industry, but", "in the pork industry. Due to meatpacking plant shutdowns at the beginning of the Covid pandemic, meat producers couldn’t slaughter as many animals as they normally do — so, instead, they ", " millions of them. Activists from the animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere were tipped off that Iowa Select Farms was using ventilation shutdown plus, a then little-known method, to exterminate its pigs.", "In an investigation later ", " by the Intercept, the activists secretly planted recorders and captured audio of the pigs shrieking for two-and-a-half hours as they were killed with high heat and steam. ", "These revelations, and the fact that the AVMA considered VSD+ acceptable, galvanized a coalition of farm animal advocacy groups and veterinarians who are AVMA members. They petitioned the AVMA and ", " to its House of Delegates, a voting body that guides the organization’s policy, to re-classify VSD+ as “not recommended” in its guidelines. They wrote ", " and ran an ad in the Philadelphia Inquirer ahead of this summer’s AVMA convention that read: “You wouldn’t say it’s okay to roast an animal alive. So why would the American Veterinary Medical Association?” ", "The European Union ", " any type of VSD to be a method that’s “likely to be highly painful” and “must never be used.” But the AVMA hasn’t changed its position, and there are signs that it doesn’t intend to.

Baysinger, who is ", " of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians and serves on the AVMA’s animal welfare committee, didn’t respond to a request for comment.", "The ", " on VSD+ in poultry birds cited in the AVMA’s guidelines is an unpublished, poultry industry-funded report, which has been ", " of lacking scientific validity.", "At the International Symposium on Animal Mortality Management this past June, Cia Johnson, the head of the AVMA’s animal welfare division, said: “We need data from you … Even if it’s not published, if it’s a case report, if it’s proprietary data, if it’s unpublished data, the panel needs it. Some of these methods are at risk of leaving the guidelines. I think you probably have an idea of what those methods might be. We need data to support them staying in the document.” Johnson didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment.  ", "“This intrigues me: AVMA leadership actually put out calls for research to support ventilation shutdown. That’s not science. It’s not science when you have a bias at the beginning,” said James Reynolds, the Western University professor.", "“Their position is completely unreasonable. Not founded on reason, not founded on science.” ", "Heath and her allies aren’t giving up, despite the AVMA’s intransigence. In the fall, they gathered 278 signatures to submit yet another resolution to change ventilation shutdown plus’s", "status to “not recommended,” for the AVMA’s House of Delegates to vote on at its ", " this month. But the AVMA didn’t allow the resolution to move forward, citing procedural reasons. ", "The AVMA declined an interview for this story, but said in a statement that it “believes animals should only be depopulated in emergency situations, and only after all other options are considered and found not to be viable … Alternatives are exhaustively sought, but when thousands to millions of animals are impacted by such emergencies, depopulation is sometimes the only option. In many cases, the method used to depopulate the animals is limited or dictated by the situation (e.g., containment to control disease spread, natural disaster, or other unprecedented urgent situation). Selecting a depopulation method often involves ‘least bad’ choices; however, failing to depopulate animals in a timely manner can lead to even worse suffering for those animals and/or pose unacceptable health and safety risks for the people who are caring for them.” ", "Even knowing how livestock veterinarians see their roles, it’s hard not to wonder how they can willingly inflict so much suffering on animals. One answer might be that they believe, or their vocation has convinced them to believe, that there’s no other choice. “Veterinarians are stretched way, way, way too thin, and are almost always inevitably overwhelmed with work,” Lisa Moses, the bioethicist from Harvard,", "said. “And that does not allow you to have the mental space to ask big-picture questions. You’re just trying to figure out how to get through terrible situations as best as you can.” ", "Often in her advocacy, Heath said, livestock vets ask her: What else do you expect us to do? If meeting America’s demand for abundant cheap meat sometimes requires inflicting great suffering, their thinking goes, that’s the price we have to pay. “I personally believe [ventilation shutdown] is a compromise — a necessary compromise, and an unfortunate compromise,” poultry veterinarian Simon Shane, who criticized Heath and other opponents of VSD+ in a ", ", told me. “People who have protested against ventilation shutdown should provide a viable alternative.”", "Pressed on whether not raising so many animals in intensive confinement could be a viable alternative, he replied, “I’m in the business of feeding people” and, later, “I really don’t want to get involved in a fruitless discussion on ethics and morality.”", "Other vets argue that instead of taking the American system of meat production for granted, the profession could actively challenge it. “If the only way to ensure that large swaths of our patients are not routinely killed by heatstroke is to put in place restrictions on CAFO [factory farm] size, then core principles of veterinary medical ethics, like the duties of beneficence and nonmaleficence, require that our profession advocate for such restrictions,” Reyes-Illg wrote in a letter to the AVMA on behalf of the Animal Welfare Institute in May.", "In June, at a continuing education ", " held by the American College of Animal Welfare, Cia Johnson was", "asked whether the AVMA has considered studying ways to reduce the need to mass cull animals. “Not at this time,” she replied. ", "The idea of cutting down meat production is a non-starter in the veterinary community, vets interviewed for this story agree, even though it’s considered a ", " part of addressing climate change and would surely be better for animals. When she took livestock medicine courses in vet school, Reyes-Illg said in an email, “The message I got was that pig vets had to work with industry somehow — there was never any mention that veterinarians might have a role in disrupting the ongoing expansion and intensification of animal agriculture.”", "Outside North America, veterinary groups often espouse a different philosophy. “At the British Veterinary Association, we encourage everyone to consider the environmental impact of their dietary choices and have long campaigned for a ‘less and better’ approach to consuming meat,” Justine Shotton, the British Veterinary Association’s then-president, ", " the Daily Mail last summer. ", "This is the discussion that forward-thinking vets in the US dream of having. “If all the AVMA is doing is thinking about depopulation, then that’s all we’re going to get,” Heath said. “But the more the AVMA could put energy and thought into scaling down animal agriculture, then we have the possibility of moving things in the right direction.” For now, though, she and fellow animal advocates are laser-focused on ending the worst meat industry practices — on making the bad system we have a little less bad. She’s looking forward to the AVMA’s next conference this month, where she plans to keep starting conversations the AVMA would rather not have. "]},

It will require corporations to prove that most products they sell in (or export from) the EU made with cattle, coffee, chocolate, soy, palm oil, wood, or rubber are produced without destroying or severely damaging forests, from 2021 onward. That includes both illegal and legal", "deforestation — companies can’t clear trees, even if local laws permit it. ", "The EU law will also provide a degree of clarity into corporate supply chains, Mowat said. Before selling into EU markets, companies will have to reveal the location of farms where each of their commodities has been produced; they’ll have to trace, say, boxes of chocolate back to a specific grove of cacao trees.", "The EU is likely to formally approve the legislation this spring, Walker said, and it will enter into force soon after. Larger corporations will then have a year and a half to comply; smaller companies will have two years. And the regulation includes a range of potential penalties for companies that don’t comply, from fines to sanctions.  ", "The EU law is, for now, one of a kind. No other countries prohibit the sale of several different products linked to deforestation, according to Walker. (Many countries, including the US and Australia, do prevent companies from importing timber tied to illegal forest loss.)", "Governments in a handful of other countries, however, have proposed similar policies. In the fall of 2021, for example, a group of mostly Democratic lawmakers in the US introduced a bill known as the FOREST Act, which seeks to bar companies from importing certain products associated with recent deforestation. Those include the same products covered by the EU regulation, such as cattle and coffee.", "Like the EU law, the FOREST Act — short for the Fostering Overseas Rule of law and Environmentally Sound Trade Act — could be transformative. The US is ", " beef importers in the world, and some of its supply comes from the Brazilian Amazon, where cattle ranches ", ". The United States also imports ", " than any other and is a major buyer of palm oil, chocolate, and other commodities grown in the tropics. ", "“It would be a game changer,” said Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii who introduced the bill to the Senate, because the US influences the global supply chain. “We can make markets and we can break markets,” he said. ", "There are a handful of differences between the two laws. While the EU legislation applies to all deforestation", "for example,", "the FOREST Act only applies to illegal deforestation. That distinction is not a huge concern, however, because ", " tropical deforestation related to agriculture is illegal. ", "The key question now, of course, is whether the bill can pass. Congress didn’t vote on the FOREST Act in 2021 or ’22, and lawmakers now face a Republican majority in the House. Plus, the legislation doesn’t have any Republican cosponsors in the Senate, Schatz said; conservative lawmakers tend to oppose regulations that companies view as burdensome.", "Sen. Schatz plans to reintroduce the bill in the first half of 2023 after making an appeal to Senate Republicans to try and secure a cosponsor, he told Vox. There’s “plenty of room for bipartisanship” around the regulation, he said, especially now that the EU bill has been agreed on. “The EU action puts wind in our sails,” Schatz said. ", "Many of the companies that stock shelves in the EU also deliver goods to the US. So they’ll have to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains regardless of what happens in the US. Agriculture companies have opposed the FOREST Act, Schatz said, but now they may see it as a losing battle. “We’re feeling pretty optimistic going forward.” ", "Environmental advocates tend to agree that the EU law will be good for forests, but it has left many developing nations — tropical countries, mostly, that produce goods for the EU — frustrated. During the drafting process, ambassadors of more than a dozen countries ", " that the EU did not sufficiently consult producer nations, even though it will impact their economies. ", "“It’s essential that the EU find ways to build effective partnerships with the most important producer countries,” said Tina Schneider, a forest expert at the World Resources Institute, a DC-based research organization. ", "Some environmental experts also argue that the EU law will do little to curtail ongoing environmental destruction. “Sadly, it’s a missed opportunity,” said Matthew Spencer, global director of landscapes at the sustainable trade organization IDH. ", "One issue is that the EU law only applies to forests but not other ecosystems with sparser assemblages of trees (known in the regulation as “other wooded lands”). For example, in a tropical savanna in Brazil called the Cerrado, which is rich in biodiversity, soybean farms are spreading, yet much of it will likely remain unprotected by the regulation. (EU policymakers will review the law within a year after it goes into force to determine whether it should also apply to other wooded lands; the US law does", "apply to other wooded lands.)", "Spencer also points out that the EU is a relatively small market for most commodities associated with deforestation, other than cocoa", "(the EU accounts for ", " of global imports).", "The law will just segregate the market, he said: Commodities that are already produced on land without deforestation will go to Europe and those linked to environmental destruction will continue flowing to places like China and India, where no such policies exist. ", "“It’s more about making European consumers feel like they’re not part of the problem, rather than actually attacking the problem,” Spencer said. “It’s effectively just pulling up a drawbridge around Europe and saying, ‘Only clean products should come here.’”", "It would be more helpful for the EU to provide incentives for farmers and ranchers that are working toward eliminating deforestation, not just for companies that are already deforestation-free, he said. ", "Still, the law will undoubtedly have far-reaching impacts, especially if it pushes legislators elsewhere to adopt a similar policy. “We believe that if China, India, the US, and Japan took the EU’s lead and emulated these key legal steps, then nearly 75 percent of the world’s imported deforestation could be eliminated within a few years,” Glenn Hurowitz, who leads the nonprofit advocacy group Mighty Earth, recently ", ".", "It will likely be years before countries in Asia follow suit. But there’s already reason to expect global deforestation to slow. Indonesia, the world’s largest oil palm producer, has recently ", ". Brazil, meanwhile, just elected a president who, in the past, ", " astronomical rates of environmental destruction.

During aducanemab’s development, clinical trials were halted at one point because analysts had concluded any further investigation was futile: The drug did not work. Nevertheless, in 2021, the FDA approved the drug over the objections of its own scientific advisers and ", ".", "A recent ", ", released in late December, revealed the extent of the FDA and Biogen’s cooperation in pushing the drug to market. Two months after the clinical trials were halted in 2019, a Biogen executive and a senior FDA official met at a pharma conference and decided Biogen would push ahead with seeking approval. What followed was highly unusual coordination between a private company and its regulators, who met dozens of times to review Biogen’s data and even cooperated on briefing documents for the FDA scientific advisers who would give a final recommendation on approval.", "Usually, in those documents, the opinions of the applying company and the FDA regulators are kept separate. But this time, any distinction was muddled, according to the House report, with the FDA even asking Biogen to insert FDA-drafted language into the company’s section of the report.", "“The findings in this report raise serious concerns about FDA’s lapses in protocol and Biogen’s disregard of efficacy and access in the approval process for Aduhelm,” the House committee wrote. “The criticism surrounding Aduhelm’s approval may have been avoided had FDA adhered to its own guidance and internal practices.” ", "After the FDA’s scientific advisers pointed to the lack of clear evidence that aducanemab slowed the development of dementia, as well as signs of serious side effects, Biogen and its FDA partners switched gears and sought accelerated approval instead — which has a lower threshold for approval. Biogen just needed to show that the drug did reduce the amount of amyloid plaque in a patient’s brain, not that the reduction then in fact stalled the decline in cognition. Company and FDA staff worked together to produce a statistical analysis that demonstrated the desired result, despite federal officials saying previously that they would not use such a secondary metric to authorize an Alzheimer drug’s approval.", "Accelerated approval was granted for aducanemab — for which Biogen initially planned to charge $56,000 — in July 2021. But the drug’s momentum post-approval quickly slowed. Major health care institutions said they would not administer the drug, given the lack of empirical support for its effectiveness.

But some experts have challenged that hypothesis and accused drug companies and academia of overlooking other avenues for trying to treat the disease. Lecanemab, the newly approved drug, and aducanemab are both premised on the so-called amyloid hypothesis and target those plaques in the hope of alleviating dementia symptoms. ", "The evidence for lecanemab’s effectiveness is stronger than aducanemab’s.

Alison Lynn, director of social work at the Penn Memory Center, told me that she’d heard from excited caregivers and patients. ", "But the clinical staff has concerns. “Our docs seem very optimistic about the more promising data on lecanemab, but cautiously so,” she said. “Some of the concerns from the debacle with Aduhelm remain the same, even with better data.”", "Concerns about equitable access are paramount. Will Medicare cover this drug, unlike aducanemab? If not, access could be limited to the very wealthy, given ", " for an annual course of treatment. Ideally, patients would receive a brain scan for amyloid plaque before receiving lecanemab, but that procedure is typically not covered by Medicare and can cost upward of $20,000 out of pocket. Patients will still need to go to a hospital to receive the injection every two weeks, which presents another barrier to access for people who struggle with dementia.", "“What will we do when someone with more advanced dementia comes in and asks for this drug even though the data really only supports early-stage use?” Lynn said. “Basically, there are concerns about the logistics and ethics of access.”", "The approval of a new Alzheimer’s treatment should be cause for celebration. And there is good reason to believe that lecanemab will prove to be more successful than aducanemab.", "But recent events also give good reason to be cautious.

Del Rio said this issue is one IDSA is actively advocating to change.", "It’s not only ID training programs that are facing challenges. Pediatric ID programs only filled half of their available training slots. And other fields that have been and will continue to be first-line during public health emergencies are also seeing waning interest: ", " emergency medicine training spots were filled this year than last year.", "Ku wasn’t sure exactly what he’d do to fix the system’s problems, but any viable solution would need to restore some of what initially drew so many ID practitioners to the field. “ID as a specialty has to be sustainable,” Ku said. Doctors need to feel joy and passion for what they do every day, “without feeling like they’re a hamster in a little wheel that just keeps going on and on and on and on.”"]},

This announcement is an important incremental advance, but the breakthrough doesn’t go far enough to be of practical use. Because NIF itself is a research laboratory, its technology is not intended to produce power. So designing a fusion reactor to harness this new approach will be its own engineering challenge. ", "NIF is part of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, operated by the US Department of Energy. “This is what it looks like for America to lead, and we’re just getting started,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said on Tuesday.", "The ", " first revealed on Sunday that a fusion breakthrough announcement was imminent. ", "Nuclear fusion refers to the reaction where the nuclei of tiny atoms like hydrogen and helium collide and stick together, generating immense heat, which could, in theory, be used to make electricity. That’s in contrast to the fission reaction used in conventional nuclear power plants, where large atoms like uranium are split apart. The trouble for fusion is that the nuclei are positively charged and thus repel each other. To get them to overcome their opposition, you have to get them moving really, really fast in a confined space and create a high-energy state of matter known as plasma. ", "Scientists have struggled for decades to do this. There are two main approaches: One is to compress a tiny pellet of fuel with powerful lasers, which is NIF’s strategy. The other is to heat up plasma to temperatures hotter than the sun and contain it with magnets. This is how ", ", the world’s largest fusion project, currently under construction in southern France, will generate the reaction. ", "The sun and other stars can pull this off because they have enough matter to generate immense gravity, which accelerates and confines atoms to create fusion reactions that produce the light and heat we can experience from millions of miles away. ", "Here on Earth, humanity has actually known how to produce fusion since 1952 — in thermonuclear weapons. Scientists have been able to produce fusion in laboratories as well, but only intermittently, and at great energy expense: Imagine using a blowtorch to light a match. The slow progress in pursuit of fusion has also made it a struggle to get adequate research funding, which in turn hampered progress. ", "In 1997, the ", " established ignition as the goalpost for fusion at NIF. It defined ignition as “gain greater than unity,” meaning more energy out of the fuel target than the amount of laser energy hitting it. ", "For months, scientists at NIF have gotten tantalizingly close. About a year ago, they said they were about 70 percent of the way there. “We’re on the threshold of ignition,” ", ", a plasma physicist at NIF, ", ". ", "Now they’ve crossed that line. ", "“This result clearly surpasses that mark leaving no question that they achieved fusion ignition in the laboratory,” said ", ", a plasma physicist at the University of Michigan, in an email.", ", a plasma physicist at the University of California Los Angeles, explained that while NIF has achieved a massive breakthrough, it’s still short of what’s needed. As the National Academy of Sciences pointed out, the key metric is the fusion energy gain factor, also called “Q.” This is the ratio of the power used to start and maintain a fusion reaction compared to the power produced. A gain of 1 means the reaction has broken even. The latest announcement at NIF shows a gain of roughly 1.5, meaning the reaction has become energy-positive. ", "But that’s only if you define the energy input narrowly to the laser energy hitting the fuel target. If you measure from the total amount of energy needed to charge up and fire the laser, about 300 megajoules, the recent results are still far short. To actually produce more energy from fusion than the laser requires from the power grid, you would need a gain of 100 or more.", "Another limitation is that NIF can only fire a few laser shots per day, and the amount of electricity required can sometimes cause blackouts at the lab. To run an actual fusion reactor, you’d need to fire about 10 shots per second. ", "The fuel itself could also stand to burn more efficiently. “The NIF shot only burned a small fraction of the fuel in the capsule,” Carter said in an email. “If you can find a way to burn up more fuel, the gain goes up substantially.”", "That will involve tweaking the tiny fuel pellet to get more of the laser energy directed toward compressing atoms. ", "As for the laser, NIF is using dated technology that has a lot of room for improvement. The lasers are only about 1 percent efficient in terms of turning electricity to laser light, while more modern designs can be 20 percent efficient. “The NIF is built on 1980s laser technology,” said ", ", director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, during a press conference.

I think they’d be wrong, but it really is true that making a spending deal would have more predictable consequences in this regard. The 2011 deal did considerable harm but did not result in a recession, which would have been even worse.", "Convincing the administration to take another path requires figuring out some way to reassure markets in the aftermath of Biden nullifying the debt ceiling, and to prevent the legal risk inherent in that measure from wreaking economic calamity. I don’t know how to do that myself; if I did, I’d say something. But luckily there are many people who know these markets better than I do who are hopefully working on ways to make this option more attractive to the administration.

Shane said that while there are some things parents and day care providers can do to somewhat reduce disease transmission among small children, there’s just a certain level of germiness that comes with the child care territory. “We sometimes affectionately refer to child care centers as Petri dishes,” she said. Preschool-aged children “share everything — including saliva and mucus and all of their secretions —with other children,” she said.", "Child care in the US takes place in lots of different settings.

Most providers are already extraordinarily attentive to cleaning their own hands and those of the children they care for.

Although soap and water are best if hands are visibly soiled and there’s time to ensure thorough washing with soap, Shane said sanitizing hands with a small amount of alcohol gel often has the added benefit of making fingers taste bad — which may disincentivize little ones from putting them in their mouths. ", "Another strategy most parents are already well aware of is getting kids vaccinated on the recommended schedule against common infections, which offers excellent protection against many of the biggest infectious threats of childhood. But parents may not think to ask their child care facility whether the other children and staff are fully vaccinated. That’s something they can and should feel free to do, said Shane.

They make money either way. Let’s break down what Presbitero and his colleagues found.", "Rewards cards are a booming business for issuers and popular among consumers across the credit spectrum. According to the ", ", even people with “deep subprime scores” — meaning very low credit ratings — put over 60 percent of their credit card purchase volumes on rewards cards, and almost three-quarters of near-prime consumers did the same. The highest-credit consumers are the biggest rewards power spenders. (If you need a full explainer on the United States’ credit score system, ", ".) ", "How much bang people are getting for their buck, if any, really shifts across the credit spectrum, according to Presbitero and his colleagues’ research. They found that people with super-prime credit (those who have a FICO score of 780-850, the upper limit) on average earn $9.50 in rewards and pay $7.10 less in interest each month on rewards cards compared to run-of-the-mill classic cards. Subprime consumers, meaning people with credit scores below 660, earn just $1.80 in rewards and pay $6.40 more in interest. “We estimate an aggregate annual redistribution of $15 billion from less to more educated, poorer to richer, and high to low minority areas, widening existing disparities,” their report reads.", "The researchers looked at two specific areas where what they call “naive” consumers make more mistakes with rewards cards: they overborrow, and they don’t pay their credit card debt in an ideal way. They focused on rewards cards that offer points, miles, or cash back for dollars spent; the data did not contemplate perks such as airport lounge access. ", "On the first front, they took a look at bank-initiated credit limit increases on rewards cards, meaning instances when the bank says something like, “Hey, here’s an extra $1,000 on your credit limit, go nuts.” They found that such increases led to higher unpaid balances among consumers with low credit scores — they upped their spending because they could, but they weren’t able to up their ability to pay that debt back. ", "“If you’re an unsophisticated guy, you get this $1,000 more, you increase your consumption and your spending, but you are not able to increase your repayments because you are constrained,” Presbitero said. “You end up with unpaid balances, and on those balances, you’re going to pay interest rates and charges. So, yes, maybe you’ll get like $2 in rewards, but then you have to pay $5 in interest.”", "On the second front, the researchers examined people with multiple cards at the same bank and looked at how consumers addressed their different debts. They found that low-credit consumers “tend to follow a sub-optimal (and costly) balance-matching heuristic when repaying their credit cards,” meaning they didn’t pay down their cards in the best ways. For example, they focused too much on cards with higher balances and not cards with higher interest rates, where the debt would ultimately be more costly.", "Presbitero said that the issue isn’t necessarily that certain consumers don’t know how to best approach paying down debts and handling their rewards cards, it may just be that it doesn’t really matter to them, or they’re not paying attention. “They may be so rich that they don’t care,” he said. “It could be that you are unsophisticated and you don’t know, or it could simply be because of what economists call rational inattention; it’s rational for you not to pay attention.”", "Whatever the case, when people screw up with rewards cards, they pay a price — and that price ultimately helps pay for the rewards of people who don’t. ", "On an aggregate level, this has a geographic impact. Presbitero and his colleagues note that, on net, average rewards are higher in zip codes with higher education levels, higher average income, and a lower share of Black residents. ", "Thinking about where credit card rewards come from can be uncomfortable. Yes, they are nice when you get them, but they’re not inevitable or really necessary. It’s a little awkward that consumers are offered a prize for the act of engaging in capitalism, and one where there are fairly significant trade-offs, on net, among consumers, merchants, and other stakeholders.", "The important thing to keep in mind here is that credit card companies and banks are in the business of making money, and they would not be handing out rewards cards if there were not something in it for them. In this case, there are billions of dollars on the line.", "Issuers make money on rewards cards holders regardless, across the credit spectrum. The researchers found that banks profit most from near-prime and prime consumers in the middle of the FICO score distribution. At the high end and the low end of the FICO range, the ways banks make money differ. For subprime consumers, over 60 percent of banks’ revenue on rewards cards comes from interest income. For super-prime consumers, more than 80 percent is from interchange income, meaning the swipe fees merchants pay when people spend. In the middle, banks can make money on both interest charges ", " swipe fees.

A new approach emerges, a decisive break with the past, and a fresh group of practitioners arise to push the boundaries of their form — and each other.

They were hit hardest when the pandemic took hold, but as the economy has rebounded, they’ve reaped some real benefits. They really have been able to hop jobs more and, in turn, drive up their wages. Businesses may also be hesitant to lay them off, because hiring them back in the first place was hard.

It’s unlikely the next recession will be an exception to the historical rule.", "“If we do see a recession, yes, it will be bad for lots of folks, but I would expect the unemployment rate for people with college to get up to 5 percent and people with high school, no college, up to 10 percent,” Darling said. “There will be a lot more pain, and it won’t be evenly distributed.”", "The construction sector has been resilient despite the slowdown in the housing market, but how long that will last is an open question. Eventually, weakness in housing will trickle through. “There’s this huge backlog of work that needs to be done,” Zhao said, “but at the same time, that backlog can’t sustain employment forever if the housing market does remain depressed and there’s less demand for construction in the future.”", "The same goes for leisure and hospitality. People are still going out and about and traveling, but if the economy gets bad enough, they’ll stop. “If there’s a broad slowdown in the economy, people are just like, ‘Okay, I’ll go out to eat less,’” Bunker said. That’s going to hurt the guy who works at the restaurant down the street, not an engineer at Facebook.", "Employment in transportation and warehousing, which got a pandemic bump because of increases in ecommerce and delivery, is already starting to cool off, Zhao noted, as consumer behavior normalizes. “In that industry, we have seen jobs come down quite significantly over the last few months. It’s not back to pre-pandemic levels, but we have seen a slowdown there,” Zhao said. That doesn’t necessarily mean companies in the sector are doing mass layoffs — many can just depend on attrition to whittle their workforces down. ", "The possibility of a recession has everyone a bit on edge, whatever their income level, and again, if and when the next downturn comes, it won’t be fun for anyone. White-collar layoffs at some big-name companies are not the death knell they might sound like. There are real risks ahead, and if they come to fruition, their effects will stretch far beyond Salesforce and Morgan Stanley."]},

This is a particularly useful rhetorical device for those in the public eye: reality TV stars, celebrities, billionaires, and ", ", to name a few, but it’s just as often used by regular people defending the things they like. Recall, if you will, the many, many times the internet has debated whether it’s okay to criticize popular culture at all, or whether we should all just shut up and “", ".”", "(Before we go any further, a note: By “hater,” I mean a vocal critic of a certain media property or celebrity, not someone who hates entire groups of people or engages in personal attacks or bullying. That said, there is no hard line determining whether a statement is a personal attack or reasonable criticism — and to be on the receiving end of criticism often feels extremely personal, regardless of how measured the criticism is. That only makes differentiating them more difficult, and the need for nuance more crucial.) ", "There’s a second rhetorical device beloved by influencers who despise “haters,” and it is the concept of “spreading positivity.” It works like this: Society has long bristled at the idea that there is a class of laborers who make money simply by posting on the internet, and that the influencer’s job often appears to be to make sure everyone is very jealous of them. In response to this line of criticism — that they’re being materialistic or flaunting their wealth, that they’re vapid, that they’re contributing to a culture that prioritizes aesthetics over substance — the influencer will say that all they were trying to do in the first place was “spread positivity.” An example: After Jake Paul, a YouTuber who has been accused of hawking scams to his fans multiple times, opposed ", "’s social media ban last August, ", " he “had nothing but positivity to spread.” ", "It’s a term that’s been used to justify so many different kinds of unjustifiable behaviors that “spread positivity” is essentially meaningless on the internet.

Her content is part of a larger wave of people online embracing being “a hater,” “toxic,” or an otherwise unsavory internet label. “How I sleep after a day of being a proud hater and starting arguments and spreading negativity,” ", " of a person looking particularly snug. “Hating on ppl is so fun, I’m a hater fr, I wake up everyday ready to spread negativity and hopefully ruin lives,” ", " with nearly 200,000 likes. Online, you’ll find usernames and podcasts with names like “Spread Negativity, Be Toxic” and people delightedly tossing around catchphrases like “", "!”  ", "They’re jokes, obviously, but they’re also a pushback against the idea that divergent beliefs are inherently poisonous. “Gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss [is] a meme that’s now used to point out the hollowness of capitalism or organizations like the CIA co-opting social justice talk,” wrote my colleague Alex Abad-Santos in an explainer of the phrase. “Spreading negativity” feels like a way to needle at the vapidity of those who claim to “spread positivity” regardless of the harm their actions cause.

Anti-fans, many scholars have suggested, subvert the traditional mode of media consumption, wherein we’re supposed to accept and like the thing we’re watching. “As active, engaged viewers, we are not supposed to dislike, and we are meant to treat dislike with suspicion in others because liking has been characterized as a progressive effort to champion the underdog in popular media,” writes Anne Gilbert in the anthology ", ". ", "Social media, where like and dislike can be quantified, only widens the chasm between fans and anti-fans. On forums and in comments sections with character limits, where punchy, unambiguous responses are upvoted and prioritized by algorithms, the nuance between the two extremes often gets lost. It’s partly why people whose jobs necessitate being in the public eye (influencers, for example) ", " in which only two types of people exist: followers and haters. It’s an understandable frame of mind when much of the attention they see is either from ardent superfans or death threats. ", "Ironically, despite her TikTok bio, Lichtstein makes an effort not to fall into this trap. “It’s not about just having negative things to say, but having ", " things to say,” she explains. “Nothing is black and white, there’s a gray area. When people criticize me, I think, ‘Is this a valid criticism, or are they just calling me fat and ugly and stupid?’ If they’re saying, ‘I really like what Talia has to say about feminism or whatever, but sometimes I can’t deal with the yelling,’ then that makes me want to mix it up and maybe be a bit more soft-spoken, because then it could reach more people.”", "I ask what she hates most right now. The first answer she gives is indicative of her more recent diatribes, against harmful influencers like Andrew Tate and regressive politics. “I hate the culture of misogyny online,” she says. “I feel like a lot of people are, because of social media, falling for these hate campaigns against people like Amber Heard and Meghan Markle.”", "There’s another thing that’s bothering her, too. “I hate the rain,” she adds. “I hate the people who are like, ‘Oh, but we ", " it!’ But it’s not fun and doesn’t benefit me.

It can depend on the industry, the job level, and the purpose.", "“There’s a fine line between appropriate and inappropriate,” said Sondra Levitt, a leadership and career coach with Korn Ferry, an organizational consulting firm. For example, it might make perfect sense for a company to ask a candidate, especially at the executive level, to do some sort of presentation about their vision and what they want to accomplish. Where it gets hairy is when the company asks a candidate to create, produce, and submit a full-blown marketing campaign, which happened to one of Levitt’s clients recently. “The candidate felt like they were just trying to get free information and free work through the interview process,” Levitt said.

A ", " from hiring software company Greenhouse found that 60 percent of job seekers were “unimpressed by time-consuming recruitment processes.” There’s no concrete explanation as to why many employers have been so insistent on making the hiring process so hard — it’s likely an amalgamation of factors.", "Companies are afraid to make the wrong decision.

She added that technology has likely also played a role in making the hiring process more complex. “These Zoom interviews are a lot easier than bringing candidates into the office,” she said.

Before the pandemic, she would have probably had to go to the office one day for a string of interviews, the firm recognizing she couldn’t just disappear at random from her current job for weeks on end. But with her simply clicking a Zoom link, the company was able to sprinkle interviews across multiple weeks. ", "Machado believes that the increasingly long maze of recruitment and interviewing is driven, in part, by pride and by companies competing against each other to be considered the most elite places to work, especially in the tech world. “You want to be the most challenging interview. If you can get past the Facebook interview, you can get past anything,” she said. The caveat is that the best interviewers are not always the best people for the job, and a difficult interview process does not guarantee the candidate won’t quit. “There’s too much emphasis on screening people out and not on screening people in.”", "Perhaps the simplest answer to why companies make it so hard is that they can.", "In 2005, it took two interviews for Stacey Aldstadt, an environmental lawyer, to get her job as general manager of the city of San Bernardino’s municipal water department, from which she retired in 2017. While there, she oversaw 300 employees and a $120 million budget. In late 2020, she decided to apply for a job at a cannabis company looking to expand to California. She was subjected to a seven-interview, eight-week hiring process that culminated in an impersonal rejection email without explanation. Aldstadt has hired people in the past, and this seemed incredibly excessive. “I would never do that to someone,” she said. “Not in a million years.”", "If and when candidates feel like the employer is overdoing it in an interview process, the options are a little limited. To a certain extent, you kind of just have to go with it or walk away. But there are ways to navigate.", "It’s helpful to ask questions to ascertain expectations around interview assignments — figure out why they’re relevant and how they’ll be evaluated, and get assurances that the work remains proprietary. You can also try to decipher if there are alternatives, such as providing samples of previous work, or ", ", though the answer might be no. At the outset of the hiring process, it’s also a good idea to ask exactly what it’s going to entail — how many interviews, with whom, on what timeline — and hold the company or recruiters to it. ", "“If a company is not communicating effectively with a candidate, if they are super opaque about the process and the timing, that’s where it gets really, really icky, and it can leave a candidate just feeling so confused,” Carnahan said. ", "Candidates should also set some boundaries, which are different for everyone. Machado generally recommends the job seekers she works with do no more than four rounds of interviews. And if they’re asked to do a presentation or take-home assignment, it’s time to evaluate whether it’s a place they really want to work. Sometimes, candidates worry the potential employer will use their work. It might be more often the case that they don’t look at all. “They’re making people do these assignments, and then no one checks it,” Machado said. ", "It’s important to remember that if a company’s hiring process feels off, working there might feel off, too. An employer having to reschedule multiple interviews because the interviewers are swamped at work might be a sign that things aren’t great, internally. “You’re definitely interviewing the company as much as you’re being interviewed, so stay attuned to what you are hearing and seeing,” Levitt said. “What’s your gut telling you about this company? About this job? About the organization?”", "Companies should take note that being a complete pain to deal with in recruiting is not great for their reputations, either. They can stall so much or put candidates through such a rigamarole by the time they put out an offer, the candidate’s just over it. More broadly, while job seekers may not have a lot of options to fight back, they can talk to others about their experiences, and they definitely do.", "Jessica says knowing what she knows now, she still probably would have applied for the fundraising job. Still, she wishes the organization hadn’t checked her references as a last and apparently unnecessary step. “It was a little weird for someone to be like, ‘Oh what happened to this?

The pressure to make more stuff, of course, lowers the quality of what’s being made, because the development and testing is just accelerated even more.” ", "Design is more than the mere aesthetics of an object; it can also be a solution to a problem.

", ", industrial designers often focus on three things: appearance, functionality, and manufacturability. That last part is where the most change is happening. ", "Historically, Bird says, if a craftsperson wanted to make something — say, a tea kettle — you would adjust it with each attempt. Maybe the first iteration was hammered metal and the handles were uncomfortable. Perhaps the next was ceramic, but it didn’t sing when the water was ready. You would go back to the drawing board. “Eventually, in a couple of generations of tea kettles, I would be making the perfect form that did everything perfectly,” Bird says. “It’s all great because I was responding to my customers one at a time and it was handmade.”", "The first major shift came when the ", " introduced machinery and tooling into the design process, exponentially increasing the scale of production. Now, instead of hammering out one kettle, you could use a machine to stamp out the parts. Rinse and repeat. However, if you designed a bad tea kettle, you would be stuck with thousands of them — a huge, expensive mistake. This is still the case.", "While machines have dramatically increased how much can be produced and how fast, humans are still mostly involved every step of the way from ideation to production. Today, nearly everything is assembled by human hands, even if some parts are 3D-printed, cast, or spun by machines. “You’ve done all these other steps, and then you have the person who sits there and actually puts these pieces together,” says ", ", a writer and lingerie expert. “It doesn’t matter how complicated. It doesn’t matter how simple. We don’t have robots that put together our clothing automatically, so it’s all done by an expert.”", "The Great Depression, too, changed the very nature of consumerism. The economy desperately needed stimulation — and consumer goods were one way to do it. It was around this period that advertising heavyweight ", " laid out a selling strategy that came to define purchasing habits for the next century: “consumer engineering,” or how advertisers and designers could artificially create demand, often by making older objects seem undesirable. Real estate broker Bernard London is often credited with coining this process as “planned obsolescence” through his ", " that suggested the government put a lease on products’ life. “That’s when manufactured products started to be sort of done in season for the cycles and fashion,” Bird says.", "Fast-forward a handful of decades, and now several generations of people are conditioned to buy the new thing and to keep replacing it. Companies, in turn, amp up production accordingly. It’s less so that objects are intended to break — functional planned obsolescence, if you will — but rather that consumer mindsets are oriented around finding the better object. But “better” doesn’t always mean long-lasting when companies are incentivized to produce faster and faster and faster. ", "Let’s circle back to the bra I bought a decade ago and its lesser younger sibling. ", "When I spoke to Harrington, the lingerie expert, about my dilemma, her first question for me was about price. To my recollection, the old bra and the new one were about the same: somewhere between $30 and $40. That, for Harrington, was the key: In the last 10 years, in the wake of the climate crisis and the pandemic and steady and then skyrocketing inflation, the cost of fabric, other materials, and labor has increased. ", "It can be difficult for consumers to recognize that the landscape has changed because they’re not primed to see the full picture, Harrington explains. She mentions how when she writes about the state of fast fashion, she often gets pushback from new readers who say their older fast fashion pieces have lasted a long time. “Yes! Many of us bought cheap clothing 10 years ago that’s still fine,” she says. “But 10 years ago, our clothing was higher quality than it is now. That is actually part of the point.”", "It’s actually impossible to buy the same bra I had in high school for the same price. It’s simply more expensive to produce now than it was then.", "“People don’t exactly want to pay more for all that stuff,” Harrington says. “So what has to happen if everything is more expensive and the customers still want to pay the same price, something has to be cut and that’s often going to be the quality of the garment.”", "Usually that’s accomplished with a change in material. This could be a thinner, new-to-market fabric, or a more fragile clasp, for instance. The average customer isn’t going to know the difference, especially when shopping online. “There is an entire generation of consumers at this point that doesn’t actually know what high-quality clothing feels like and looks like,” Harrington says. “It gets easier, I think, for consumers to just not know any better.”", "The electronics industry is also susceptible to material changes because products are competing against each other on price point, says Gay Gordon-Byrne, the executive director of the ", ".", "“Even though designers may say, ‘Oh, this is just as good,’ the components themselves are increasingly plastic instead of metal,” she says. “They’re using more glue instead of screws. There’s some definite design trends that are making these things not work very long. A friend of mine was a big HP reseller and he said that it used to be that you could take that $4,000 HP LaserJet that you’d have in your office, drop it off the back of a truck, and plug it in. It would still work. But that was no longer the case as new generations came around and they were made with more and more plastic.” ", "Then there’s the classic way companies keep costs low: ", ". The speed at which workers are expected to produce and deliver goods is faster than ever before — and speed will always be at odds with quality. An ", " for same-day or two-day delivery, as well as the hunger for real-time ", ", are both incentivizing companies to churn, churn, churn. ", "Take a gander at ultra-fast fashion giant Shein’s ", ". Social media ", " the trend cycle even further. Consumers are buying ", " than they did back in the 1980s. In order to produce goods that fast, both the quality of the item and the ", " have to take a hit. This is happening alongside a decrease of prices for the consumer (not rooted in reality!) to encourage more trend-oriented shopping and ", ".", "“Time is money,” Harrington says. “Even as poor or cheap as that garment worker’s labor is, it’s still a significant part of the garment because there is no way to replace that labor. Some of what you’re seeing in that race to the bottom is that literally the time is not being spent in making the thing that would help the thing last longer. If you spend cheap money on something, you cannot expect it to be high quality. You have to make a choice there.”", "Finally, there are shifts in production methods that help companies avoid higher labor costs. Again, robots do not wholesale make our things, but for products like phones, computers, remote controls, and the like, it’s often cheaper to design in a way that reduces human labor. This can mean using as few parts as possible; if you can design by plate or by chunk, especially if the object has to be manually completed, it’ll save a lot of time, and therefore money. ", "“In the design of objects, they’re trying to reduce the amount of labor, and that changes what the object is,” Bird says. “That produces cheaper goods, but it doesn’t necessarily produce better goods.”", "While pinching pennies can sometimes lead to interesting solutions to old problems, a whole new suite of issues tends to unfurl. For the fashion industry, it’s easy to look at the rise of synthetic materials, which offer utility for exercise clothing as well as a way to avoid using animal products. Synthetic fabrics, however, are made from petroleum and have propelled the industry to become one of the ", " in the world. Synthetics also have a paradox problem: They fall apart easier, but they don’t entirely ", " as well as natural material. ", "The tech industry has similarly had to contend with the fallout of seemingly improving on products while at the same time simplifying design elements to save money. Apple’s ", " is a prime example; the thinner keyboard was great for reducing a laptop’s weight, but the keys got stuck all the time. Because the keyboard was designed to be one piece, a consumer couldn’t fix a single stuck key by themselves without the right equipment — they had to go to the Apple Store to replace either the keys or the whole keyboard. Kitchen appliances and other utilitarian objects are now also suffering the same fate with the inclusion of techy selling points (touchscreen blenders, automatic espresso machines, those goofy fridges with the screens on them), but with little maintenance infrastructure or the ability to repair those new features, Gordon-Byrne says.", "“One of the problems being a designer is that you solve some problems and in the process of solving them, you invent all these new problems,” Bird says. “That’s just an inherent part of design. There’s no way to not do that. If you’re creating innovation, you’re also creating future problems.”", "So the cycle continues.", "Design has shifted more toward manufacturability and appearance than functionality, when it should be a balance of all three. Arguably, it’s nearly impossible for corporations to avoid participating in the trend cycle as long as consumers have an appetite for more — whether it’s a predilection for cooler clothing or whatever new incremental yet buzzy technology just came out. At the same time, the blame does not lie on consumers’ shoulders; corporations are responsible for creating and stoking the “new and more is better” culture we have today.", "Perhaps if companies took the first step and made their products feel timeless both in form and function, there’d be less demand for new things and a decreased pressure for speed. But major corporations will almost certainly never go for that, and it’s unlikely the majority of consumers will unlearn current buying habits.", "“A better iPhone would be one that I can use for 20 years and keep upgrading,” Bird says. “But that’s not how we define better, right? Nobody wants an iPhone 14 because it will last for 10 years. They want it because it has a fancier camera or whatever.”", "Even if you do want to hop off the treadmill of constantly buying and keep what you already have, companies have made that harder too. Your goods probably have a shorter life span than they did years ago, and if you want to repair them — especially tech — you’ll come up against major barriers.

This meant swinging by the dreaded Genius Bar or an authorized third-party shop to fix a broken screen until 2021, when Apple ", " it would finally sell the parts required to open (and therefore fix) a device following years of activism from folks like Gordon-Byrne and pressure from regulators. Apple’s products still remain some of the toughest to repair on your own, ", ", but the company is not alone in opposing right-to-repair; Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Tesla, John Deere, and General Electric have all spent billions ", ".", "“Why I’m fighting so hard for a right to repair is that nobody is telling me I can’t sew a button,” Gordon-Byrne says. “Nobody is refusing to sell me a needle and thread. Where that’s exactly what’s happening with technology. It shouldn’t happen. That level of control should not be their level.” ", "There is hope thanks to consumer action, says Gordon-Byrne. New York was the first to pass a ", " last month, and the ", " has been investigating the issue. ", "“I see this every day,” Gordon-Byrne says. “Consumers are so much more powerful politically, legislatively than they ever dream — and it’s not the act of voting. That’s probably the least powerful thing. The most powerful thing is for a consumer to literally pick up the phone, call their local representative. Let me tell you, when I sit down with a legislator, I can hand them a list of 400 names of their own constituents that say, ‘I want my right to repair.’ That’s huge. That moves the needle. It moves the ball.”", "Learning how to fix your own stuff can be simultaneously overwhelming and empowering, says Zach Dinicola, the founder of ", ", a company that repairs KitchenAids in Kansas and other parts of the Midwest. It’s a “crying shame” that there are efforts to make it harder to fix things on your own, he said, which is why he ", " with more than 450,000 followers on TikTok. ", "“I think that there are more people who want to fix it,” he says. “They just don’t necessarily know it’s an option. People don’t know what they don’t know. There’s a DIY person in all of us. If someone can present the information in a format that’s easy to follow along, more people would be willing to do that.” ", "The beauty of fixing an object and keeping it around in your life, Dinicola continues, is that the object becomes very sentimental. “That’s one thing that I just know from being in this business,” he says. “These mixers really become part of the family, especially when they’re handed down from grandmother to mother. I’ve worked on third- and fourth-generation mixers that have been handed down from great-grandma to grandma to mom to daughter.”", "You could probably say the same thing for vintage clothing — what’s better than getting a chic leather purse from your mom’s closet or the cool secondhand shop in your neighborhood? Although no one is prohibiting people from repairing clothing, the lack of quality in modern fashion means it’s important to be thoughtful about what you’re buying and how you’re ", " of what you already own. Knowing ", " is key to knowing how to wash and dry it, which can elongate its life. “If I visit the tab for fabric composition and there’s nothing there, it’s an instantaneous red flag,” Harrington says. “You want to know what fibers are in the garments you’re buying. That in and of itself is something everyone can do. That can be the first step toward getting more familiar with what quality garments might look and feel like.”  ", "I hate to say that the onus is on us, but in many ways it is. Corporations aren’t going to do this work for us, or without us. Consumers need to be able to identify quality, learn to take care of what they own, and advocate for regulations and legislation wherever right-to-repair doesn’t yet exist. Buy less or secondhand, and when you do buy something new — it happens! — make sure to do your research. "]},

When assets are put into a trust, the original wealth-holder technically no longer owns them. A third-party entity, known as a trustee, manages the assets for a named beneficiary until the terms of the trust are fulfilled — for example, a parent establishes a trust for their child that will transfer assets to them when they turn 25 or upon the parent’s death. A trust is supposed to end at some point, and ownership of assets is supposed to pass to the beneficiary; it’s a way station for wealth, not the final destination.", "Except that a growing number of trusts don’t end. None of the 13 tax haven states has a strict life span limit on trusts. Several states have abolished a rule limiting the life span of trusts altogether. Others set the limit somewhere between 300 and 1,000 years. By carefully setting up a dynasty trust that lasts generations, a wealthy family can avoid paying inheritance or estate taxes for millennia. These trusts often obfuscate who really owns the assets, so they can continue using them — assets like real estate or yachts — or take out “loans” from the trust without triggering gift taxes. The secrecy and confusing ownership structures of trusts are big problems. The government can’t tax something that legally doesn’t belong to a person anymore, and it certainly can’t tax assets that it doesn’t even know exist.", "Whether and how states tax residents matters not only because it can worsen inequality, but also because it’s states, not the federal government, that make many of the decisions that affect people’s day-to-day lives.

But Bovino said extra savings that households accumulated during the pandemic should provide some cushion for the economy. ", "In the pandemic’s early days, many Americans stocked up their savings after shifting spending away from in-person events, and lawmakers passed rounds of stimulus measures to prop up the economy. Those extra savings, along with the fact that households aren’t carrying heavy debt loads, should help stave off a more serious downturn, some economists said.", "Still, many Americans are ", " as inflation has surged and stimulus programs have expired. Much of those savings are also being held by higher-income households that might not spend that extra money during a recession since they could become more worried about their job stability and might already make enough income to cover essential costs.

But checking account balances for lower-income families are still higher than they were in 2019, according to the ", " from the JPMorgan Chase Institute.

Officials also expect the unemployment rate to rise to 4.6 percent by the end of 2023. ", "Kathy Bostjancic, the chief economist at Nationwide, said she expected a moderate recession to unfold around the middle of this year and inflation to slow to 2.8 percent by the end of 2023, according to the ", ". As inflation cools, however, many businesses could see slower revenue growth and shrinking profit margins as consumers pull back spending, Bostjancic said. ", "That could cause some employers to slow down hiring or lay off workers, meaning that even a mild recession could be painful for many people.", "“Our view is that employment growth will continue to slow and eventually there will be outright job losses,” Bostjancic said. “That will have a material impact on consumer spending, and that’ll be a big part of why we fall into recession. It’s really been the labor market and the consumer that has kept the economy buoyant, but once that turns, then the overall economy will as well.”", "Fed officials have repeatedly said they are aiming for a “soft landing” — a scenario in which the central bank raises interest rates and the economy slows just enough to bring down inflation but averts a recession.

By raising rates aggressively, officials risk significantly slowing the economy and causing a big jump in unemployment. But doing too little could allow inflation to become a more permanent fixture of the economy, which could be harder to address in the future. ", "Fed officials say a soft landing is still possible. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was targeting slow but positive economic growth, and a relatively weaker labor market. Powell has said the labor market continues to be “extremely tight,” with demand for workers still exceeding available supply. If those conditions rebalanced, he said, that would ease upward pressure on prices and wages.", "“There are channels through which the labor market can come back into balance with relatively modest increases in unemployment,” Powell said at a ", " after the Fed raised interest rates by half a percentage point in December. ", "Erica Groshen, a senior economics advisor at Cornell University and a former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said the labor market is strong and inflation is softening, which makes her believe a soft landing or a moderate recession are the two likeliest outcomes.

These strong conditions mean the labor market has more room to slow than normal, some economists argue.", "Still, Groshen noted that soft landings have historically been difficult for the Fed to pull off.", "“Maybe they will actually achieve the soft landing,” Groshen said. “But in the past, it hasn’t been easy to calibrate things that closely.”", "Bostjancic at Nationwide said it was possible for the United States to avoid a contraction in GDP if “just enough froth” comes out of the labor market, wages slow, and inflation comes down quicker than economists expect. ", "“The chances are still rather low, but they’ve started to increase recently” as inflation has slowed more than expected, Bostjancic said.", "Joe Brusuelas, the chief economist at RSM, also said his forecast included a 65 percent probability of a recession over the next year, but if inflation slows quicker than economists project and excess savings help cushion the economy, that could help the country avoid a recession. Although he said he didn’t expect the Fed to cut interest rates until 2024, he said officials could start to signal future rate cuts in the middle or end of 2023, which could boost consumer spending as households feel more optimistic about their finances. ", "Another possible outcome is a more severe recession. Although several economists said it was unlikely, it could take place if another major supply shock or geopolitical event hit the economy.", "If the global oil supply was further strained by Russia’s war against Ukraine or if China’s zero-Covid policies significantly worsened supply chain issues, for instance, that could lead to a more pronounced ", ", Bruseulas said.

", "A more drastic downturn could also result if inflation was more persistent than policymakers expect, Bostjancic said. That could lead the Fed to be more aggressive in its fight against inflation, meaning that officials could raise interest rates higher or keep them elevated for a longer period of time, further slowing the economy.

We give these people and these kinds of conversations names: “chronically online” or “terminally online,” implying that too much exposure to too many people’s weird ideas makes us all sort of lose our minds and our sense of shared humanity. For years, people on TikTok and Twitter have delighted in recounting the most “chronically online” takes they’ve ever seen; the compilation below includes a disabled woman being accused of elitism for using a grocery delivery service and a 21-year-old Redditor being accused of “grooming” her 20-year-old boyfriend.", "When I posed the ", " — “What was the most chronically online discourse you saw this year?” — the replies were telling: There was “garden coffee lady.” There was someone likening playing fetch with a dog to abuse.

Sure, you might be privately annoyed at your friend who’s always talking about how great their life is when they drone on about their perfect mornings, and you might rightfully point out when an author has an unsavory past, but it’s unlikely that the subject coming up in conversation would lead to mass ridicule.

Particularly in discussions of mental health and disability, it’s not always clear whether the person on the other side of the screen is in a safe state of mind. It’s easy to forget, in other words, that writing a long and furious Twitter thread about something seemingly inconsequential isn’t usually indicative of a logical headspace.

The rest of his weekend is a similarly expensive caricature of a certain kind of hypersocial, hyper-consumerist urban 20-something: He eats, in one day, (another) cotton candy cocktail, a tower of margaritas with hot wings, small plates at a bougie-looking restaurant called Alpana followed by more small plates at Tanto, popcorn at a rooftop cafe, as well as a slew of increasingly gluttonous and unhinged meals and beverages.

", "“There’s so little self-awareness in what people are choosing to post about themselves,” says Mike Schwanke, who created the Chicago parody TikTok. Crucially, he explains, it’s the tone of faux humility and earnestness with which creators narrate their videos that he finds so grating. “They’re posting as though their lives are normal or nothing special, but to most people, they’re a rich kid living in Brooklyn who’s living a fucking insane life.” ", "Kay, meanwhile, avoids the negative comments she sometimes gets. Rather, she sees her vlogs as a way to “romanticize the boring moments of my life,” she tells me. “My videos show a very soft, slow life, and it’s a feminine trait. But I love it, and I love seeing people slowing down and enjoying their life.” Few people on the internet are afforded the privilege to ", ", and it’s easy to see how a “day in my life” video can become a straw man for our own fears and desires of what and who, exactly, is wrong with the world. ", "For me and many others I’ve talked to, “day in my life” videos are opportunities for voyeurism, sure, but they are also satisfying on a more basic human level: By watching other people be productive, we get to feel productive ourselves. In the span of a few minutes or even less, we’ve seen a person get up, get dressed, clean their home, beautify themselves, prepare meals, send emails, take an exercise class, grab a glass of wine with a friend, and cuddle with their cat before lights out.

It was simply too much work without a real point: That day, like most Tuesdays, was going to be pretty ordinary and visually unstimulating. ", "Schwanke theorizes that this, though, is the point of “day in my life” videos: to push back against the idea that social media is just a highlight reel. “It seems like a very Gen Z thing to do, to post your everyday life as a retaliation to millennials, who grew up posting their trips to Cabo,” he says. “But what you get is essentially like the same product. In a lot of these videos, what’s funny is that in a lot of the clips you can see their friends will have their phones out, too, taking videos at the same time. Nothing is actually happening because they’re all posting.”", "Perhaps that’s the reason why so many “day in the life” videos, no matter how aspirational or ostentatious, share a quiet melancholy. Here is a person who just wants to be seen when they are by themselves, when nobody else is around. Maybe they’re looking for some kind of meaning, maybe their lives feel small, or maybe they feel so big that they can’t help but want to share it. It’s why I think the best “day in my life” videos are the ones that give voice to all the anxieties and self-consciousness that come with being a person who spends a lot of time thinking about how they present to the world. Louise May, a UK-based TikToker, has built a following of a million with her ", ", which are spoken in second person and peppered with thoughtful, funny asides, the kind that pop into your head as you walk to the refrigerator, excited about the overnight chia pudding you made yesterday, only to open it up and realize it hasn’t set properly. ", "No “day in my life” video is ever going to be a perfect representation of someone’s existence, but they’re more fun to watch when they’re made by people who spend the time to ask the fun kinds of questions: What are we all doing? Is this what life is? And, more importantly, how many margarita towers per weekend is enough?"]},

", "It’s a difficult balancing act for the Fed. Officials risk dramatically slowing the economy and causing a painful spike in unemployment if they raise rates too aggressively. But the Fed also risks doing too little and allowing inflation to become a more permanent fixture of the economy, which Fed Chair Jerome Powell has argued could be harder to address in the future.

Before taking action, pause and review all of the information you have about the separation as outlined in those meetings, says Lauren McGoodwin, founder and CEO of the online job resource website ", ". Companies aren’t required to offer severance, but many do, and severance details may be a part of these documents.

Is your severance paid out as a lump sum or a continuation of your salary over a certain period? Will your health insurance benefits be continued, or will you have to ", "? Is the company willing to pay for other assistance, like a career coach? “Let’s say they’re giving you a single lump sum,” McGoodwin says. “How much of a runway does that give you before you need to job-search again? Because maybe you need to go back and try to negotiate for a larger lump sum. Or maybe you’re okay with that lump sum, but … because your whole family uses your health insurance, you really want a longer continuation of the health insurance benefits.”", "Your needs can help guide your negotiations with the company regarding the terms of your separation. Think about what you’d be willing to do without in order to get what you want. If the company is offering three weeks’ pay for every year you worked at the business, but you’d rather have an extension of health insurance coverage, you can suggest dropping to two weeks’ pay for every year and continuing health insurance coverage. If you haven’t been offered severance pay at all, always ask for it, Davis says. The company may outright refuse any negotiation, McGoodwin says, but it’s worth asking.", "When discussing the terms of your separation, bring up any concerns you have, Green says. Say you reported discrimination within the last year and now you’re being laid off. You have reasonable grounds to suspect it might be retaliation.

", "If you suspect you’ve been laid off based on age, race, or gender, or if you recently reported harassment or other wrongdoing, you may want to talk with an attorney. Should you not sign the exit agreement, you won’t get any of the pay or other benefits outlined in the document. ", "Regardless of whether your company is offering a severance package, you’ll want to have a set plan for health insurance.

You can also ", ".", "With livelihood logistics out of the way, update your resume, LinkedIn, and portfolio so you can let your network know you’re searching for a new job. McGoodwin recommends sending an email to professional contacts or mentors that includes a resume and your LinkedIn profile as well as a message explaining the type of job you’re looking for, your skills, and if they have any leads or connections. “That way they can say, ‘Do I know someone within that world that I can help connect them with?", "” McGoodwin says.", "Reach out to your former manager and ask them what the company will tell future reference checkers about your performance and the reason you left, Green says. “A layoff itself is not something that should be held against you,” she says, “but if you are selected for your layoff in part because of your performance, you do want to know that so that you’re not blindsided if it comes up in a reference later.” ", "In the weeks following the layoff, structure will be your greatest asset. “Schedule your day for job searching the same way you would schedule your day when you are doing a work project,” McGoodwin says. Rather than spend five consecutive hours firing off applications for roles you don’t really want, dedicate two or three hours applying to exciting positions.", "Have a friend or mentor look over your resume and cover letter to provide feedback, Green advises.

He offered online training sessions but could not arrange in-person training because, McConnell explained, he had “just too many requests.” A diagram for the Model X implied there was magnesium in a part of the car that did not, in fact, contain magnesium. There was no extrication video guide for the company’s Model Y car (extrication is the firefighter term for removing someone from a totaled vehicle). It would be difficult to get a training vehicle for the Austin firefighters to practice with, McConnell added, since Tesla is a “build to order manufacturer.” Most of Tesla’s scrap vehicles are recycled at the company’s Fremont plant, he said, though a car could become available if one of Tesla’s engineering or fleet vehicles crashed. ", "McConnell’s long email reflects the current approach to fighting EV fires and the fact that fire departments across the country are still learning best practices. Even now, there isn’t consensus on the best approach. Some firefighters have considered ", " cranes to lift flaming EVs into giant tanks of water, although some automakers discourage submerging entire vehicles. Rosenbauer, a major fire engine and firefighting equipment manufacturer, has designed ", " that pierces through the battery casing and squirts water directly onto the damaged cells, despite some official automaker guides that say firefighters shouldn’t try rupturing the battery. Another factor that needs to be considered, added Alfie Green, the chief of training at the Detroit Fire Department, is that there are new car models released every year, and there is particular guidance on how to disconnect different cars. ", "While some standards have been released, others are still being developed, and fire departments are still catching up with National Transportation Safety Board recommendations. There’s also the matter of just getting the vast number of firefighters up to speed on EVs. O’Brian, the fire chief from Michigan, told Vox that the federal government needs to take a much more active role in funding research and helping buy EVs that fire departments can practice on. ", "Another complication is that EV fires present different risks in different places. The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) hasn’t had to fight any electric car fires yet, but it is facing e-scooter and e-bike fires, which are on track to ", " and ", " endanger delivery workers in the city. Batteries that lack safety certifications or are charged improperly are more likely to ignite, explains John Esposito, the FDNY’s chief of operations. In November, 43 people were ", " in a Manhattan building fire that the department ultimately linked to a battery-powered micromobility device — possibly a scooter — that had been kept inside an apartment.", "Small towns face unique hurdles. In Irmo, South Carolina, which is home to fewer than 12,000 people, there’s concern about getting the right equipment to deal with EV fires. While there haven’t been any high-voltage battery fires yet, Sloane Valentino, the assistant chief of Irmo’s fire department, told Vox he’s not sure whether the town has enough engines to fight a Tesla fire while also responding to other fires in the area. ", "“We don’t have the capacity to deal with 30,000 gallons worth of toxic runoff. Some of it’s going to turn to steam,” Valentino told Vox. “We’re kind of back to, ‘Let it burn.’ When you see the big, violent flames shooting out of the car, just kind of protect what you can — try to cool the roadway — but let the car burn.” ", "While internal combustion vehicles have been around for over a century, EVs are still relatively new, which means they could become even safer as more money and research pour into the technology. Remember the melting separator in the battery that creates thermal runaway? General Motors is studying how its battery separator could contribute to improved battery safety. The Department of Energy is working on technology that could incorporate flame retardants directly into the batteries’ design. Engineers are also investigating new battery chemistries, like less-flammable electrolytes. Though research is still early, ", ", which would replace a liquid electrolyte with a solid that’s far less likely to ignite, also show promise. ", "“Batteries are hopefully going to be getting better over time,” said Michael Brooks, from the Center for Auto Safety. New regulation could push battery safety even further, he added.", "In the meantime, fire departments are working on adjusting to this new category of fire —  just another reminder that the rise of electric vehicles involves far more than simply replacing gas tanks with batteries. And firefighters will be the ones driving some of these new EVs. In May, the Los Angeles Fire Department ", " the first electric fire truck to hit the road in the US. The bright red engine is made by Rosenbauer, and it comes with a front touchscreen, a remote control tablet, two onboard batteries, and a backup diesel range extender. Other departments are now waiting for their own EV fire trucks to arrive. ", "Meanwhile, back at the Austin Fire Department, Smith says he has encountered at least one EV fire since the Model X accident a year and a half ago. That one didn’t involve the battery, so it was like fighting any other car fire. But in the months following the 2021 crash, the fire department did go ahead and jury-rig a new firefighting nozzle to deal specifically with EV fires. The department hasn’t heard anything more from Tesla. "]},

In what ways can your attempts at self-improvement help serve those values? If having quiet time in your day is important to you, but you get frustrated whenever you attempt to meditate, perhaps reading a book before bed is a more achievable intention. ", "The problem with resolutions, Milkman says, is they’re too abstract: ", ". These goals are admirable, but they don’t offer a guide on how to achieve those resolutions. After you set your benchmark goal, plan how you’ll do it. Ask yourself questions like “When will I volunteer?” “Where will I volunteer?” “How will I get there?” “How many hours a week will I dedicate to volunteering?” ", " that when people are intentional with how to implement a change, they’re more likely to achieve their goals. ", "Context is crucial to your plans. “Our goals may set the tone and motivate us to create habits,” Chamorro says, “but it’s actually engaging in daily, context-specific behaviors that creates a habit.” If you’re mapping out how to achieve a resolution, such as the popular resolution of ", ", think about how this goal fits into your pre-existing routines. Maybe you throw on workout clothes right after making your bed and before brushing your teeth and then you go for a 10-minute walk. Perhaps you want to cut down on alcohol in the new year. Make your surroundings more amenable to that goal and remove any adult beverages from your house and swap your wind-down glass of wine with a mocktail. ", "For people with already limited time, adding more items to your to-do list can be a deterrent to self-improvement. Milkman suggests focusing on one manageable goal at a time. Instead of vowing to be a more present parent, child, and friend, dedicate 30 minutes a week to a phone call with your parents. ", "New Year’s resolutions tend to fall under the umbrella of behavioral goals, where someone commits to doing something different in their life, says ", ", the Heinz University professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Jumping into a massive life change isn’t sustainable for most people, and far-reaching milestones can feel overwhelming and difficult. People often ditch their goals if they’re too easy or far too difficult, Milkman says, so breaking down your resolutions into bite-sized targets helps people stick to these goals. For example, if you’re resolving to eat healthier, a first mini-goal would be to buy more fruits and vegetables. Second, try not to let these foods go bad. Next, ", " three days a week, and build up from there. “The secret sauce of goal setting is breaking it down into task strategies and sub-goals,” Rousseau says. “You’re less likely to blow it off because it starts to seem too big a deal, too hard to do, too hard to fit in my life.” ", "A ", " co-authored by Milkman showed that when faced with a big commitment of agreeing to volunteer for 200 hours a year, people not only stuck to their goal but actually dedicated more hours to volunteering when the goal was broken down into four hours per week as opposed to hours per year. So, if you’re looking to save up for a big vacation this year, telling yourself to sock away $5 a day will be more effective than reaching for $150 in savings a month, even if they equal the same amount.", "Sometimes reaching our goals feels uncomfortable and unpleasant, like those first few times at the gym or when your new hobby gets a little boring. When these annoying and painful moments rear their heads, people are unlikely to persist with the change, Milkman says. However, making these tasks or sensations more enjoyable and rewarding helps you stick with it. If you’re vowing to read more, treat yourself to a latte when you’re about to pick up a book. Or save your favorite podcast to savor while you’re on your self-imposed daily walk. “By combining a temptation with a chore,” Milkman says, “that chore becomes something that’s actually associated with pleasure and you start looking forward to it instead of dreading it.”", "Incorporating a social component not only makes your tasks more enjoyable, but having an accountability partner ", ". Enlist a friend with a similar goal to share tips and solidarity — and to make a potential chore a social event. Especially if your goal is to drink less, enlisting an ", " is a means of catching up, checking off a few items on your to-do list, and socializing without the pressures of alcohol. “When we give advice to others who are working toward similar goals, that actually improves our own performance,” Milkman says. “Having a back-and-forth coaching situation with someone else striving in a similar direction can be useful.”", "The idea is for your mini-goals to become a part of the fabric of your life, “rather than just a thread,” Rousseau says. Standalone tasks — like going to the gym — are difficult to maintain on their own, but going to a yoga class with a friend or treating yourself to sushi afterward helps integrate these activities into our schedules. “If I do this, I get this,” Rousseau says. “If I do this, I see these guys; if I do this, it takes me into this neighborhood and then I’ll do these other things.”", "Inevitably, there will come a day when you break your knitting streak or need to spend money on an unexpected expense and miss your financial goal. Everyone slips up, but those who see mistakes as an opportunity for growth as opposed to failure are better positioned to move forward, Milkman says. “There’s research showing that basically if you teach people about the malleability of things like IQ and performance in school, it leads to better outcomes because they stop thinking, ‘God, I’m so dumb,’ when something goes wrong — it’s like, ‘Oh, I just need to study harder and I can do better,’” she says. “It’s true not just about academic performance.”", "Embrace the rest days, the treats, the catering to temptations — and remember the key to goal achievement is persistence, not perfection, Rousseau says. In fact, missing a few days of a new behavior doesn’t impact the habit-forming process, ", ". In these moments of fallibility, re-engage with your goal. Why did you make this resolution? Where do you want to be a year from now? “When we have those kinds of interruptions, the idea is to reaffirm your commitment to the goal by reflecting on what is the outcome you want, what is the self you want to be, and where you are now,” she says. “This discrepancy is something I want to close… So it gets me back on track.”", "When mapping out how many days a week or month you’d like to dedicate to a new hobby, for example, incorporate “get out of jail free” days, too. If you told yourself you’d practice guitar seven days a week with three “get out of jail free” days, you’d still meet your goal if you picked up the instrument four days a week. ", " people are more likely to persist with their goals with these “emergency reserve” days integrated into their schedules because built-in forgiveness is inherently more attainable.", "Aiming for self-improvement is never a bad idea, Rousseau says, and despite the cliché of New Year’s resolutions, you shouldn’t feel deterred from wanting to better yourself.

Or does it hand back some control to a powerful person, allowing them to prune their public image and inject an exculpatory spin on the unfolding narrative of FTX and of Bankman-Fried himself?

But it’s been a long time since Amazon has blown the public away with a new product or service. Alexa debuted all the way back in 2014, and that division was hit with some of the deepest cuts in the fall.

He also called the cost-cutting exercise “a perfectly reasonable thing to do for a company that is doing several hundred billion dollars in revenue and that has grown meteorically.”", "Indeed, Amazon’s current predicament has been startling to many because of the financial results the company was posting in recent years. Before the pandemic, in 2019, Amazon’s revenue grew more than 20 percent year over year to more than $280 billion – an impressive rate of growth for a company of that massive size.

For comparison’s sake, the giant discount retailer Target generated just over $92 billion in revenue during that same timeframe. Amazon added an entire Target worth of business, plus a Dick’s Sporting Goods for good measure. ", "In 2021, as people began returning to their pre-pandemic shopping habits, Amazon’s revenue growth decelerated to 22 percent with nearly $470 billion in revenue. And in the first nine months of 2022 (Amazon reports results for the final quarter of 2022 the first week in February), year-over-year revenue growth decelerated all the way to 10 percent.

Jassy decided Amazon’s layoffs and cuts had to follow.

The current employees were granted anonymity because they are not permitted to speak to the press without Amazon’s permission, and the former company leaders requested it so they could talk candidly. In recent years, many of these sources told Recode, ideas for new products and services were not being evaluated with the same rigor and frugality that Amazon was known for.

No. Have we built devices or experiences where we built it because it was cool tech but it didn’t really solve customer needs? Absolutely. There was less rigor and discipline around actually solving customer problems.”", "Another issue, according to a different manager who left in 2022, is that Amazon had begun attempting to invent new things just for the sake of it.", "“We grew and expanded for so long that we were driven by the idea that we must innovate, but we didn’t always ask if customers really want that,” the former manager said. “We convinced ourselves they did, but now Jassy is asking, ‘What is the real motivation, and for whom?’”", "It’s a delicate balance for Jassy and the company to maintain: Even with these criticisms, some of those who spoke to Recode worried that Jassy’s focus on cost-cutting may cause Amazon to miss out on the next breakthrough idea that could become a future pillar of the company. ", "“You go up to leadership with a big, maybe wacky, idea, and there was just a very heavy reticence to even consider it,” the longtime exec of more than 15 years told Recode of the time following Jassy’s appointment to the CEO role in July of 2021.", "On the other hand, it’s quite possible that the approach that worked for Amazon for the last 10 years may just not be the approach that will work for the next 10. If Amazon was burning more money in recent years but big ideas were still fewer and further between than a decade ago, perhaps something was bound to give.", "That’s how Columbia’s Cohen sees it: “The new CEO is willfully steering the ship toward the future with a more methodical and careful approach,” he told Recode. “There is a transition here that is necessary and appropriate. Amazon can’t be all things to all and can’t chase every rainbow.”", "For some, the combination of Jassy’s deep operational experience at the company coupled with greater emotional intelligence — “I think Jassy cares and gives a damn about employees more than Bezos ever did,” one former manager said — is fostering some confidence.", "“I’m as bullish on Amazon as I’ve ever been,” an employee of more than 10 years who works in a division not impacted by the layoffs told Recode.

For better or worse, these terms are powerful.", "We don’t just glom on to these terms because they’re catchy. We keep using them because they describe something real that’s happening, and they help us make sense of the rapidly changing world around us and allow us to see ourselves within that world.

For many Americans, announcing boundaries with work reflected the acceptance of a more transactional relationship with work.

We have political actors who don’t really believe in democracy anymore, who believe that they can’t actually lose elections.

Stable Diffusion is an image generator created by the startup Stability.AI that will produce an image for you based on text instructions, and ", " by feeding the AI images and their associated captions collected from the web, which allowed the AI to learn what it should “illustrate” based on the verbal commands it received. ", "While the particular approaches used to build generative AI models can differ, this technology is ultimately trying to reproduce human behavior, creating new content based on the content that humans have already created. In some ways, it’s like the smart compose features you see on your iPhone when you’re texting or your Gmail account when you’re typing out an email. “It learns to detect patterns in this content, which in turn allows it to generate similar but distinct content,” explains Vincent Conitzer, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon. ", "This method of building AI can be extremely powerful, but it also has real flaws. In one test, for example, an AI model called Galactica that Meta built to help write scientific papers ", " that the Soviet Union was the first country to put a bear in space, among several other errors and falsehoods. (The company ", " the system offline in November, after just a few days.) Lensa AI’s Magic Avatar feature, the AI portrait generator, sometimes illustrates people with ", ". It also has the concerning ", " to ", " ", ". ", "It’s easy to find other biases and stereotypes built into this technology, too. When the Intercept asked ChatGPT to come up with ", ", the AI suggested higher risk scores for people from — or who had visited — Syria and Afghanistan, among other countries. Stable Diffusion also ", " racial and gender stereotypes, like only depicting firefighters as white men. These are not particularly new problems with this kind of AI, as Abeba Birhane and Deborah Raji ", " in Wired. “People get hurt from the very practical ways such models fall short in deployment, and these failures are the result of their builders’ choices — decisions we must hold them accountable for,” they wrote.", "Generative AI isn’t free out of the goodness of tech companies’ hearts. These systems are free because the companies building them want to improve their models and technology, and people playing around with trial versions of the software give these companies, in turn, even more training data. Operating the computing systems to build artificial intelligence models can be extremely expensive, and while companies aren’t always upfront about their own expenses, ", " can stretch into the ", ". AI developers want to eventually sell and license their technology for a profit. ", "There are already hints about what this new generative AI industry could look like. OpenAI, which developed the DALL-E and ChatGPT systems, operates under a ", " and plans to receive ", " by 2024, primarily through selling access to its tech (outside developers can already pay ", " in their apps). Microsoft has already started to use the system to ", " of computer programming in its code development app. Stability AI, the Stable Diffusion creator, wants to build ", " of the technology that it could sell to individual companies. The startup raised more than $100 million this past October. ", "Some think ChatGPT could ultimately replace ", ", which powers one of the biggest digital ad businesses in the world. ChatGPT is also pretty good at some basic aspects of coding, and technologies like it could eventually lower the overall costs of developing software. At the same time, OpenAI already has ", " available for DALL-E, and it’s easy to imagine how the system could be turned into a way of generating advertisements, visuals, and other graphics at a relatively low cost. ", "AI tools are already being used for one obvious thing: schoolwork, especially essays and online exams.", "These AI-produced assignments wouldn’t necessarily earn an A, but teachers seem to agree that ChatGPT can create at least B-worthy work. While tools for detecting whether a piece of text is AI generated are emerging, the popular plagiarism detection software, Turnitin, won’t catch this kind of cheating.  ", "The arrival of this tech has driven some to declare the end of ", ", and even homework itself. While those predictions are hyperbolic, it’s certainly possible that homework will need to adapt. Some teachers may reverse course on the use of technology in the classroom and return to in-person, paper-based exams. Other instructors might turn to lockdown browsers, which would prevent people from visiting websites during a computer-based test. The use of AI itself may become part of the assignment, which is an idea some teachers are already exploring. ", "“The sorts of professionals our students want to be when they graduate already use these tools,” Phillip Dawson, the associate director of the Centre for Research in Assessment and Digital Learning, told Recode in December. “We can’t ban them, nor should we.”", "It’s hard to predict which jobs will or won’t be eradicated by generative AI. Greg Brockman, one of OpenAI’s co-founders, said in ", " that ChatGPT is “not yet ready to be relied on for anything important.” Still, this technology can already do all sorts of things that companies currently need humans to do. Even if this tech doesn’t take over your entire job, it might very well change it. ", "Take journalism: ChatGPT can already write a pretty ", ". No, the post might not be particularly accurate — which is why there’s concern that ChatGPT could be quickly exploited to produce fake news — but it can ", " get the ball rolling, coming up with basic ideas for an article and even drafting letters to sources. The same bot can also earn a good score on a college-level coding exam, and it’s not bad at ", " legal concepts, either. A photo editor at New York magazine ", " that while DALL-E doesn’t quite understand how to make illustrations dealing with complex political or conceptual concepts, it can be helpful when given repeated prodding and explicit instructions.", "While there are limits on what ChatGPT could be used for, even automating just a few tasks in someone’s workflow, like writing basic code or copy editing, could radically change a person’s workday and reduce the total number of workers needed in a given field. As an example, Conitzer, the computer science professor, pointed to the impact of services like Google Flights on travel agencies.", "“Online travel sites, even today, do not offer the full services of a human travel agent, which is why human travel agents are still around, in larger numbers than many people expect,” he told Recode. “That said, clearly their numbers have gone down significantly because the alternative process of just booking flights and a place to stay yourself online — a process that didn’t exist some decades ago — is a fine alternative in many cases.” ", "Generative AI is going mainstream rapidly, and companies aim to sell this technology as soon as possible. At the same time, the regulators who might try to rein in this tech, if they find a compelling reason, are still learning how it works. ", "The stakes are high. Like other breakthrough technologies — things like the computer and the smartphone, but also earlier inventions, like the air conditioner and the car — generative AI could change much of how our world operates. And like other revolutionary tech, the arrival of this kind of AI will create complicated trade-offs. Air conditioners, for example, have made some of the hottest days of the year more bearable, but they’re also ", ". Cars made it possible to travel extremely long distances without the need for a train or horse-drawn carriage, but motor vehicle crashes now kill ", ", at least in the United States,", "every year.

Legal cases about who deserves ", " — but also ", " — for work created by AI are being decided now, but could shape who profits from this technology for years to come. Schools and teachers will determine whether to incorporate AI into their curriculums, or discard it as a form of cheating, inevitably influencing how kids will relate to these technologies in their professional lives. The rapid expansion of AI image generators could center ", " at the expense of other artistic traditions, which are already underrepresented by the technology.", "If and when this AI goes fully mainstream, it could be incredibly difficult to unravel. In this way, the biggest threat of this technology may be that it stands to change the world before we’ve had a chance to truly understand it."]},

Tank trucks carrying thousands of gallons of fuel are a near-ubiquitous presence on the highway. Auto repair shops are stocked with drain pans and wrenches for oil changes. Gas prices are a central focus in politics. Even pedestrians and cyclists depend on the hum of the internal combustion engine — it’s a powerful audio signal that a car might cross their path.

In the next few years, electric vehicles will replace many cars with internal combustion engines, and the White House has called for half of new vehicles to be electric by the end of the decade.

They just reflect how tailored our roads, our cities, our cars, and even our personal driving habits are to internal combustion technology.
